# Coin Hub

Coin Hub is an R&D project for working out potential features and functionality towards a bigger application that solves the below problem:

Onboarding the average investor into the crypto space is high friction with awkward workflows which can include many transaction costs and with the potential of transaction mistakes potentially resulting in total loss of funds.

High level solution:

Easily and with low friction capture and onboard users as the population migrates into the crypto space.

- Make it easy for users to deposit and withdrawal fiat currency at low cost
- make it easy for users to securely buy and sell crypto from a third party exchange (Binance)
- Make it easy and secure for users to deposit and withdrawal crypto between the exchange and their wallet
- Make it easy and secure for users to put their crypto holdings to work earning passive income within the Polygon eco system of DeFi

To do all the above from within one app, minimising risk, workflow friction and transaction costs

The above will empower individuals to take control of their financial future and protect their capital against the massive devaluation of nation state currencies.
