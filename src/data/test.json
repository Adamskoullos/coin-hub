      "content": "Data is just a story waiting to be told.\n\nOne aspect about data that I love is that it can tell stories of the past, the present, and opens the mind to the potential stories of the future.\n\nLet’s start with the past.\nThe Past: Context For the Present\nWhile non-fungible tokens have existed for a long time, the market for such tokens was historically small. Early marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare, which were founded in 2017, grinded through a market that was mostly dominated by Ethereum until blockchains like WAX and Flow finally launched offering application-specific chains for gaming and consumer applications. In 2020, OpenSea was \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/opensea-surpasses-20-000-users-unofficially-claims-the-title-the-uniswap-of-nfts\"\u003eaveraging\u003c/a\u003e $1 million in sales per month and the tailend of the first Covid-19 year experienced growth (now considered a kindling fire) in NFT art and collectibles sales.\n\nDecember of 2020 witnessed some uptick NFT chatter with the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/fantasy-sports-crypto-s-next-consumer-application?utmsource=MasonNystrom\u0026utmmedium=ledetweet\u0026utm_campaign=fantasysports\"\u003egrowing excitement\u003c/a\u003e of NBA Top Shots and early Ethereum card games like Axie Infinity and Sorare.\n\nWhat comes next, you may already know, but let's break it down by the data anyway.\nThe Past: 2021\nThe first NFT narrative to explode at the beginning of the year (as a continuation of 2020) was sports NFTs, specifically NBA Top Shot.\n\nCombining financial incentives with sports is a tried and true recipe and cryptonetworks with tokenized digital goods are the natural steroids for which the industry will use to reach new heights.\n\nIn tandem with the breakout of sports NFTs, 2021 will go down perhaps most significantly as the year of the digital renaissance. As the mainstream media watched the birth of new business models and monetization strategies, platforms like Nifty Gateway and SuperRare dominated, offering artists a new format for monetizing their work.\n\nNFT royalties are easily a 10x improvement from the legacy artist monetization system and nearly every artist's endeavor is examining how to issue NFTs. The joy of digital painting continues into the summer as new platforms like Art Blocks and Foundation onboard new artists and collectors.\n\nThe NFT summer moment largely becomes overshadowed with the continued growth of pfp/avatar projects and Axie Infinity’s Ronin launch, which immediately experiences rapid growth in users and NFT secondary sales.\n\nThe final leg of our saga gets told through the lens of Solana. With Ethereum experiencing heightened gas prices, pfp creation and flipping, in part, moves to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/layer-1-of-the-rising-sun-solana-nfts\"\u003eSolana\u003c/a\u003e which quickly marches towards surpassing Flow in Cumulative NFT volume.\n\nIn hindsight, August of 2021 was the peak with over $4.5 billion in NFT secondary sales, likely more when factoring in art sales and non Cryptoslam tracked NFTs (e.g digital land).\n\nThe present has a funny way of misshaping our view of the past. Although the past few months still lagged compared to the peak, it’s worthwhile to realize that the NFT secondary market is still multiples stronger than where it was at the beginning of the year. In early January, $50 million in NFT sales was a massive achievement. Now, $50 million in NFT sales is a bad day for OpenSea.\nThe Future: The Inevitable NFT Multichain Future\nThe NFT market has officially surpassed $15 billion in secondary sales combined across a variety of categories including gaming, PFPs (profile pics), virtual worlds, sports, and collectibles. More importantly, while Ethereum leads, the future is growing more multichain by the day.\n\nSeveral blockchains are developing robust ecosystems for consumer applications, built on the foundation of digital ownership enabled by NFTs. The burgeoning NFT multichain future is rapidly approaching. Three Layer-1 blockchains possess secondary volumes of nearly $1 billion (Ethereum, Flow, Solana) and Ethereum leads all blockchains and Layer-2s with nearly $10 billion in secondary NFT sales.\n\nWhile much of the NFT market is inherently financial, the growth of all digital goods and services requires initial capital investment and the public nature of crypto makes capital readily available for individuals, creators, and developers who are willing to build unique NFT protocols and products.\n\nMost of the NFT categories that witnessed explosive sales growth this year can be described as cultural NFTs – art, collectibles, sports, pfp/avatars, and more. As the world moves onto permissionless blockchains and tokenizes everything that can be tokenized, investing will become more democratized and naturally expand to hobbies including art, music, fashion, content, and more. The dawn of culture investing has only begun.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the NFT landscape emerged from a small ecosystem with a few hundred million in sales volume to a multichain ecosystem amassing billions in capital. When you examine the data of NFTs, it unpacks a robust story of wealth, human achievement, and cultural wonder. Ultimately, the data can only tell the story until now, and while it gives us useful insight into how the future unfolds, what comes next you must imagine.\n\nMessari 2022 Theses - Heroes and Battlefields NFTs\nA partnership between artist Jaen and Messari featuring an ultra-limited collection of NFT’s celebrating the fifth annual release of the Messari Theses for 2022.\n\nMessari’s Theses for 2022 takes a deep dive into crypto’s industry leaders, major trends, projects, themes and topics.

      "title": "Explain It Like I’m 5: GameFi",
      "content": "(NOTE: GameFi builds upon innovations currently facilitated by blockchains, mainly \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/explain-it-like-i-am-5-nfts\"\u003eNFTs \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/explain-it-like-i-am-5-defi\"\u003eDeFi\u003c/a\u003e. If you haven’t read about either of the two, I would recommend Messari’s overviews linked above)\n\nListen to what’s being said at conferences, on earning calls, or in boardrooms in the gaming industry, and a recurring theme stands out: GameFi.\n\nDon’t just take it from us. Top executives such as Andrew Wilson agree. As the CEO of Electronic Arts, it’s his job to position his company for disruption – and it’s no coincidence he described what’s emerging in the crypto space as “an important part of the future of our industry on a go-forward basis.”\n\nSo what is GameFi and how will it impact gamers?\n\nWell, if you’re like billions of others around the world, you probably play games or know someone who does. Collectively, the time spent in these digital worlds amount to hours “wasted time,” at least in a direct monetary sense. All the work spent building the strongest army, collecting the best items, or completing the hardest levels – over and over – disappear once you leave the game.\n\nNow what if that wasn’t the case? What if you could keep what you built? And not only keep what you earned, but also sell it to others, loan it out, or showcase it off? While that sounds like a dream, this is the promise of GameFi, and it’s why leaders like Wilson are excited about what’s next. GameFi sits under a new genre where digital economies don’t just end when the game is shut off, thus blurring the boundary between in-game resources and real-world assets. For yourself and billions around the world, it represents a paradigm shift, a chance to take back time and ownership into the average gamer’s own hands.\nWhat Does The Financialization of Games Mean?\nGameFi, a portmanteau of “game” and “finance,” runs on blockchain networks designed to merge the fun of games with the financialization of in-game economies. Distributed ledger technology is important not only to help players provide verifiable ownership of assets, but also to structure marketplaces for trading both inside and outside the game.\n\nIn this new type of game, all objects are represented as tokens on blockchain networks. So each sword, armor, or plot of land can be owned by you or anyone else on the blockchain-based game. In other words, every gamer within a blockchain-based game becomes both a participant and an owner. While game types differ in narrative, a recurring objective is the accumulation of resources. Playing the game well allows you to accumulate more in-game currency (often represented as a fungbile token) or in-game assets (clothes, land, items) represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). What’s key here is once assets are earned, you can trade them on marketplaces for other cryptocurrencies – or fiat money like U.S. Dollars – for disposable income.\n\nThe concept of play-to-earn games isn’t novel (more on that later), but other aspects of GameFi are. Broadly speaking, there’s a myriad of possibilities enabled by the combination of crypto primitives (i.e. token incentives, smart contracts, etc.) and gaming. Utilizing blockchain composability, where tokens from one application are transferable to another, game NFTs can be both vertically or horizontally integrated into a game studio gaming content. Objects from one game – for example, digital clothing or outfits – can be incorporated into other games to build out a giant world.\n\nOutside gaming, tokenized in-game assets can be used for other purposes. For instance, owners of hard to obtain in-game items will be able to prove their ownership using an NFT opening up doors for discounts for hardcore players or in-person events for gamers of certain levels.  Moreover, highly desirable NFTs sell for significant sums of money and it’s not a stretch to imagine game NFTs going for similar prices. At those valuations, game NFTs can be posted as collateral for DeFi lending protocols, loaned to individuals who need items for in-game quests, membership into exclusive digital groups, or repurposed for real-world uses. The possibility behind NFTs as financial assets earned through games is ripe for innovation and yet to be fully explored.\nA Brief History of Games \u0026 Where Games Are Going\nThe opportunities surrounding GameFi are appealing, but before diving deeper, it’s worth understanding why this makes sense. What’s happening with GameFi is actually a continuation of a decades-long trend: The shift of power from game studios to the player. If we want to understand what that means, let’s take a trip down memory lane.\n\nPay-to-Play (P2P): The First Video Games\nAlmost all early video games began with the same revenue model. Users paid money to play a game. The first games like Pac-Man (left) let gamers play for a round or two before requiring more payment. Later games playable on personal computers, such as Call of Duty or World of Warcraft (right), sold perpetual licenses or recurring subscriptions. While transactions were simple, users didn’t have much influence. The most notable improvement was simply more playing time in the form of content expansion packs.\n\nFree-to-Play (F2P): Democratized Access to Games\nStarting in the late 1990’s, free-to-play games removed paid barriers to entry. Fans could download a product, start playing without having to pay upfront, and decide if they enjoyed it enough to spend money. Businesses made revenue from this model by way of ads or premium add-ons.\n\nOne example of the latter came through selling customizable appearances, known as “skins”. Skins offer little value beyond cosmetic appeal – they don’t give the purchaser any competitive advantage – yet undergo high demand from passionate fans. The game studio, Riot Games, for instance, famously became a multi-billion dollar company on the back of selling skins for their popular League of Legends franchise. Note the similarities between these skins and gamified NFTs.\n\nGames in this era are significantly more accessible. Players can sample different games, select the ones they enjoyed, and make purchases at-will to support their favorite developers. Power began to move slowly to the player.\n\nPlay-to-Earn (P2E): An Auspicious Way to Make Money\nLow barriers to entry set the stage for the first play-to-earn games. Remember how play-to-earn isn’t a new idea? Back in the 2000’s, a few free-to-play games like Diablo II and Runescape sprung up active marketplaces for in-game items. Players would complete quests to earn gold, use the gold to purchase weapons or armor, and sell the items for real money to buyers who otherwise didn’t do the same.\n\nSource: Sal’s Realm of Runescape\n\nOf course, during this era, such transactions were never recognized by the law, tax agencies, or anybody else for that matter. Gamers were able to build their own small digital economy in a niche corner of the Internet, but it was susceptible to scams, making participants more akin to shadowy online characters than hustling entrepreneurs operating within the boundary of established ecosystems.\n\nWhat’s different about play-to-earn this time around isn’t just the sophistication of the market. It’s also about the level of autonomy you have with their assets. Actions aren’t limited to what’s permissible by game studios. If an operator goes bankrupt or shuts down its servers, you don’t just lose the assets you built up. It’s why digital ledgers and NFT tokenization are important; it lets you own the asset on your own terms.\n\nGameFi Adds Blockchain as Gaming’s Future\nAll of this takes us to the present and the key question: If there’s a massive potential for GameFi, what do GameFi games look like today?\n\nThe answer may be disappointing for those accustomed to game engines on desktop or consoles. Since blockchain games are in their infancy, the first generation of GameFi has been predominantly simple card-based games (issued as NFTs) where players use their collection to battle each other. Imagine something close to Pokémon. Winning battles and completing objectives are all ways for users to gather resources in these games. Popular titles in this generation include Axie Infinity, Alien Worlds, Sorare, Gods Unchained, and more.\n\nOf these games, Axie Infinity is seen as the current leader. User counts have surged in 2021. Residents in the Philippines, hampered by lockdown restrictions, even play the game for income. Some earn more from Axie Infinity than they did at prior jobs so they now play the game for a living. An award-winning short documentary named Play-to-Earn: NFT Gaming in the Philippines actually shares the story of this phenomenon.\n\nWhile user growth signifies interest in GameFi, developers must find a way to work around high network costs. At the moment, expensive transaction fees and slow processing times on blockchains hamper the ability to replicate the top games on desktop and consoles, but ongoing experiments with network scaling should ease the challenges over time. Alternative, NFT-specific blockchains are also rolling out to accommodate larger volumes. Future games are expected to incorporate advanced gameplay when scaling is achieved, which should make them more engaging. Next generation titles like Star Atlas and Illuvium have already raised millions of dollars in venture funding to work on those ambitions.\nThe World of GameFi\nThe potential of GameFi lies within the incentive alignment. Gamers who own their gaming assets will likely become more engaged, loyal, and better stewards of the games they enjoy. To reach that end, a plethora of startups and protocols exist to support players, developers, and game studios alike. Below are some services adding value to the nascent GameFi ecosystem, ordered from proximity to gamers down to relevance for developers.\n\nPlayer Guilds\nAs the community pushes to include new gamers, one challenge is the upfront investment needed to get started. Axie Infinity creatures, for example, cost upwards of hundreds of dollars to purchase. That cost is unaffordable for many players. Long-term, this is something game designers need to solve through the game’s internal economics. Until then, capital pools have formed gaming guilds to help beginners finance initial expenses through “scholarships” in exchange for a revenue-sharing agreement. Think of them as coding bootcamp income-share agreements but for games instead of software engineering jobs.\n\nGameFi Aggregators\nGameFi aggregators function as platforms for game-related content. Gamers can explore existing and upcoming games across multiple blockchain networks. Aggregators will also allow them to manage their in-game NFTs, track earnings, and demo mini-games. The idea is to create a one-stop shop for all tokens, game releases, promotions, and more. If all this succeeds, aggregators will have the chance to expand beyond games into the realm of other NFTs such as art collections and music royalties.\n\nSource: GameFi (the platform, not the industry name)\n\nInitial Game Offering (IGO) Launchpads\nLaunchpads are platforms designed to help facilitate the IGOs, which are fundraising events carried out via crowd sale. IGOs tend to happen when a project team needs funding to kickstart the game’s release. Investors provide funding to finance a game’s development in return for discounts or access to special features before the game’s launch. Participation in launchpads requires accreditation under US regulations.\n\nNFT Blockchains\nThe pioneers of blockchain gaming, CryptoKitties, found out how congested activity can get on the network when transactions for the game’s NFTs began to account for more than 20% of all traffic on Ethereum in 2017. Competitors took that lesson to heart. Today, multiple blockchains support NFTs, bringing the so-called blockchain wars to GameFi. Games exist or plan to exist on the default network, Ethereum, as well as a variety of other general and NFT-purposed blockchains.\n\nDeveloper Tools\nAutomating away parts of the development process helps game studios get to market faster. Astute entrepreneurs realized this need and now supply developers with the tools to succeed. These include application programming interfaces (APIs), software development kits (SDKs), payment platforms, and general infrastructure services. Most of the parties working on developer tools are centralized startups with venture capital investment.\n\nGame Studios\nGame studios are the final piece in the GameFi ecosystem. In a recent study completed in the US and UK, 58% of the 197 video game developers surveyed declared plans to use blockchain in future games. 47% of the same group have already begun incorporating NFTs in their projects. Early trendsetters set the tone for blockchain games but the community is only getting started on full development efforts. That’s something to watch out for over the next few years.\nTaking Games to the Next Level\nCharacters in games need to keep leveling up. So does GameFi. Fortunately, two big tailwinds work in the ecosystem’s favor.\n\nThe first is increased interest around gaming. The rise of esports and live streaming is a recent development in the last decade solidifying gaming as not only a source of entertainment, but also as a legitimate career. Popular games now compete with traditional sports for fandom, an idea many would have deemed unthinkable even two decades ago. Crypto gaming, specifically, has seen a surge in interest. Investments dollars in gaming are among the highest compared to other NFT subverticals, highlighting a shift in venture capital focus as investors start to grasp the opportunities in the space.\n\nThe second tailwind is continued adoption of cryptocurrency. GameFi is one of several pillars concurrently onboarding new users into crypto. Combined with DeFi, NFTs, Web3, and others, increases in total blockchain activity over the next few years seem possible. Jumping from one vertical to another is frequent, meaning it’s likely GameFi will benefit.\n\nSo what does the future ultimately look like for GameFi? Predictions are speculative, but interesting activity and development is happening at an accelerated pace. Having the opportunity to own assets at will, make money from games, and connect with a broader community are widely recognized as compelling features presented in this new crypto vertical. While the future is unknown, one thing is for sure: Up until now, sentiment from participants – industry executives, game studios, investors, and gamers themselves – all seem quite optimistic.",

      "content": "A recent report by Dove Metrics revealed some insightful trends in the land of crypto fundraising. Total Q3 crypto company fundraising surpassed over 300 funding rounds accounting for $8.2 billion dollars. CeFi companies raised 50% of the Q3 capital while Infrastructure and NFTs also raised a significant amount. Surprisingly, DeFi protocols and companies raised the least amount of funds throughout Q3.\n\nZooming in, several individual companies raised massive rounds including:\nFTX – $900 million\nRevolut – $800 million\nFireblocks – $443 million across two rounds in Q3\nSorare – $680 million\nDapper Labs – $250 million\nOpenSea – $100 million\n\nThese six firms collectively raised just over $3.1 billion in funding, showing the rapidly maturing market of CeFi and continued demand for NFT exposure. Moreover, the subcategorization of these sectors shows some revealing trends.\n\nFirst, NFT gaming including Dapper and Sorare collectible raised over $1 billion while NFT marketplaces raised ~$250 million. The promise of gaming and crypto's eventual symbiotic relationship has produced a sizable appetite for fundraising in this sub-category of NFTs.\n\nFurther, as CeFi infrastructure enters a more mature life cycle, the top players are raising significant capital in order to scale and dominant their respective categories. Meanwhile, FTX still \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/centralized-exchange-nft-platforms-the-advantages-disadvantages\"\u003emarches on in its quest\u003c/a\u003e to dominate every facet of crypto.\n\nWeb3 continues to gain traction, however, Q3 witnessed a focus on Web3 infra and Web3 analytics (which \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-announces-21-million-series-a-led-by-point72-ventures\"\u003eMessari’s $21 million Series A\u003c/a\u003e was included in). The focus on analytics and infrastructure shows that Web3 still has a ways to go before reaching broader adoption. Still, notable Web3 companies, like Helium and MobileCoin completed $111 million and $66 million funding rounds, respectively.\n\nThe year and a half crypto bull market has brought traditional venture funds into the space. U.S early-stage venture capital fundraising surpassed $15 billion across nearly 1,600 deals. Additionally, existing crypto funds like Multicoin, Paradigm, 1Confirmation, Variant, a16z, et al have collectively amassed new funds with deeper pockets. \n\nWith the absorbent amount of capital sloshing around and the ever-expanding crypto market, crypto companies are raising money in one of the most opportune times imaginable. The size of the crypto market will continue to grow across all the above categories as well as within new emergent cateogries including DAOs, the Metaverse, social networks, and more. The only question remaining is will Q4 crypto fundraising outpace the previous quarter.\n\n",

      "title": "Centralized Exchange NFT Platforms: The Advantages \u0026 Disadvantages ",
      "content": "The NFT marketplace landscape is heating up with Coinbase and FTX announcing NFT platforms and trading. Centralized exchanges in general will have some key advantages as well as some disadvantages as they seek to become dominant NFT exchange venues.\nCompetitive Advantages for Centralized Exchanges:\nCentralized exchanges have some key advantages given their size and resources. Some of these advantages will be key in determining if these existing behemoths are successful in the NFT market.\n\nCustody\nAsset custody is a key benefit of centralized exchanges. Coinbase ensures that retail traders don’t misplace their assets or get locked out of their accounts from forgotten passwords. Essentially, centralized exchanges help prevent errors that your parents would make when transferring crypto.\n\nMore importantly, Coinbase and other exchanges will be able to find synergies with high-end NFT custody (e.g. Punks, BAYC) and their NFT platforms. Most high net worth individuals will opt for custody on Coinbase over self custody for their highly valuable NFTs. Coinbase will be able to list and let individuals bid on NFTs that are stored in Coinbase Custody. This will help bring NFT liquidity to Coinbase as they’ll naturally have some of the higher-end NFTs available on their platform.\n\nThere are other potential benefits where centralized exchanges can leverage their vertically integrated services (node infrastructure, staking, etc.) to add more value to their platforms, however, custody seems like the largest immediate advantage.\n\nBrand \u0026 Distribution\nLarge exchanges have massive brands, capital to spend, and strong existing audiences. For instance, Robinhood will be a formidable competitor to Coinbase because of their larger existing userbase. Similarly, Coinbase will be competitive with OpenSea and other NFT platforms. The potential for Coinbase or FTX to convert a small portion of their existing customer base into NFT traders will mean hundreds of thousands of customers. For reference, OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace has supported NFT trading for over 500,000 unique addresses (not necessarily different traders).\n\nBeyond, distribution alone, Coinbase and FTX have large brands that will allow them to find the best NFT artists and projects and have them launch (drop) on their respective platforms. This is yet another way that centralized exchanges will be able to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nPartnerships \u0026 Intellectual Property\nPaired with Coinbase’s existing userbase, the prominent U.S exchange will also possess a stronger ability to partner with large brands and influencers. FTX has acquired name rights to all your favorite franchises, and rumor has it they’re going after your high school football stadium next. Coinbase recently announced its partnership with the WNBA and NBA that will consist of unique content, innovations, and experiences for basketball fans.\n\nLarge organizations like Disney are more likely to partner with established companies like OpenSea or Coinbase that can offer legal contracts versus permissionless protocols. Additionally, centralized exchanges will have a competitive advantage of working with existing intellectual property and ensuring that royalties pass through on their platforms.\nPotential Disadvantages:\nPermissionless NFT marketplaces (i.e. Rarible, NFTX, Genie) will still have advantages over their centralized competitors.\n\nRegulation\nBy and large, the key disadvantage for U.S. exchanges like Coinbase is regulation. Many NFTs resemble securities or will likely tip-toe on the line between consumer product and financial product. Does the NFT provide governance over a DAO which takes a royalty on trade volume? Security. The cool NFT you bought directly earns royalties from a song, piece of content, or video? Security. Owning the NFT provides access to obtain other NFTs released by the project which potentially have monetary value or require the exchange of funds to purchase? Potential security. Fractinalized NFT? Security. Note this likely holds true for U.S based firms, and FTX or other non-US-centric firms might not have the same restrictions.\n\nAsset Breadth\nLiquidity is arguably the most important quality of any marketplace. Binance originally gained market share because it provided access to trade assets that weren’t listed elsewhere which in turn drew capital and users (Binance also had a great UX and onboarding experience). Similarly, Uniswap gained traction because it offered assets faster than even fast-moving exchanges like Binance. Similarly, permissionless protocols or even other exchanges may be able to list a wider variety of NFT assets and at a faster pace. Coupled with potential regulatory concerns over specific NFTs and permissionless NFT protocols may find a unique advantage to accruing liquidity whether from NFTs that generate cash flows or fractionalized NFTs.\n\nIntegrations\nOne of the hallmark traits of Ethereum is the composability of smart contracts and software. Alchemix can seamlessly utilize Yearn vaults for yield generation while InstaDapp is able to facilitate a one-click process to transfer collateral from one lending protocol to another (e.g. Aave to Compound). These types of integrations and secondary applications drive liquidity to platforms. Permissionless marketplaces, due to their open nature, will have an easier time integrating with other protocols compared to Coinbase, FTX, or other centralized NFT marketplaces.\nFinal Thoughts\nUltimately, Coinbase and FTX have the potential to build robust NFT exchanges with unique value propositions. Similar to how Coinbase and Uniswap can both remain successful, so too can Coinbase and OpenSea or decentralized NFT marketplaces. Importantly, NFT exchanges like Coinbase, OpenSea, Rarible, NFTX, or otherwise are also competing for liquidity across different blockchains and a variety of assets. The upcoming growth of NFTs across a variety of industries means that there will be plenty of opportunities.",

      "content": "My favorite addiction, er hobby, Twitter is getting deeper into crypto. Twitter has launched a slew of features like Super Follows and Ticket Spaces to monetize its platform. However, most of these attempts have been unsuccessful.\n\nTwitter Tips\nNow Twitter is rolling out tipping in Bitcoin using a Bitcoin address or Lighting-enabled wallet (e.g. Strike). While the ability to tip in crypto (Bitcoin for now) is a great feature, more people will likely link to their Venmo, Cash App, or Patreon accounts.\n\nWhile Twitter Tips will hopefully enable more creators to directly monetize their social capital, I’m skeptical the U.S will fully adopt the Twitter Tip feature. Ironically, while tipping is ingrained in the U.S. service culture (servers, drivers, etc), it is absent in our digital services. Conversely, China has a robust tipping culture for online services and streamers. However, in the U.S some Twitch streamers earn meaningful amounts in tips/donations and I expect the same will be true for prominent users on Twitter.\n\nTwitter’s Next Killer Feature\nMore interestingly, Twitter announced future plans to integrate NFTs into its platform. Twitter first launched its NFTs via Rarible in late June.\n\nNow, Twitter has apparently taken the cue from its crypto-savvy users and plans to allow NFT owners to connect their Web3 wallets(e.g. MetaMask) to Twitter, in order to verify and showcase NFTs on Twitter. ​​\n\nOne immediate NFT integration that has users excited is NFT avatar or PFP (profile pic) verification. With the integration of wallets, users will be able to verify they, do in fact, own the jpeg that they are using as their Twitter icon.\n\nTo date, NFT avatars and PFPs (profile pics) are (mostly) status serving symbols that identify an individual is:\nearly to a trend\nwealthy enough to buy the NFT\na member of a community (because they were early or wealthy)\nall of the above (must be nice)\nSome NFT avatar projects like Adam Bomb Squad provide greater utility and some recent launches have opted to add this type of utility.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, NFT avatar projects \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/web3-nft-q2-21-report\"\u003efacilitate\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/web3-nft-q2-21-report\"\u003ed\u003c/a\u003e over $600m in sales.\n\nHowever, year to date, Bored Ape Yacht Club has garnered over $500 million in sales and the total avatar sales likely surpass $2 billion. PFP or avatar NFTs are now an established asset within the NFT sector. Ultimately assets that derive their value from exclusivity and social perception will face power-law distributions, some will be worthwhile while most will be worth much less. \n\nThe Dawn of the Twitterverse\nAll of NFT and crypto Twitter is foaming at the mouth. The ability to verify and showcase their NFTs will further entrench the social value behind avatar NFTs and open the floodgates for other brands to try and create these types of non-fungible tokens. But there are other interesting applications of NFTs if Twitter can integrate crypto wallets.\n\nSome potential ideas:\nVerifying how long a user has owned an asset\nRecommending follows based on NFT owners\nSelling/auctioning NFTs from Twitter profiles\nCombining Twitter’s newsletter (Revue) with NFTs (e.g. Mirror)\nCreating social graphs by NFT owners\nBeyond just the ability to provide value to consumers, Twitter will be able to further enhance its advertising business. Imagine knowing that an individual has verified their Punk or other expensive NFT. What type of monetization premium would brands pay to advertise to those individuals?\n\nHumans have a strong desire to assign status. It’s part of our culture. The value proposition of these status-based NFTs is greater when combined with social media. Once individuals have verified NFTs, there are groups, tiered perks, Spaces, and other features that Twitter can combine to build an even greater platform (read monopoly). So far, most social media platforms have failed to implement crypto. If Twitter can integrate NFTs and build greater social utility into its platform, many users might be spending even more time in the Twitterverse.\n",

      "content": "Recently, UCLA basketball player Jaylen Clark became the first NCAA athlete to launch his own social token, $JROCK. The collegiate athlete also boasts a strong social media following with over 22,000 subscribers on Youtube. The UCLA guard issued his social token on Rally, a social token issuance platform that supports the creation of “creator coins”. The intended purpose of creator coins is to help facilitate an economy around a creator or influencer by providing them additional monetization strategies. Currently, fan or coin holder usage on Rally is limited to holding, tipping, and transacting. However, fans may be eligible for exclusive access and premium benefits that a creator offers such as gated membership to discord channels, NFTs, or other features. Finally, the Rally Network is underpinned by the Rally token which acts as the source of collateral for all creator coins issued on the platform. The Baller and Youtuber plans to offer tickets for $JROCK token holders as well as unique content for his subscribers. \n\n$JROCK is the start of what will be a wave of athletes using social tokens and NFTs to monetize their brands.\nNCAA: Not Controlling Athletes Anymore\nClark is able to issue a social token because all collegiate athletes now possess rights over the monetization of their name, image, and likeness. The Supreme court finally overruled the NCAA’s longstanding monopoly over student-athletes which has historically kneecapped individuals from making money based on their valuable brands. And if you’re not thinking, “damn, how will these young athletes survive without the protection of the NCAA” then you’re probably not on social media. The deals started flowing in almost immediately after the July 1st date where athletes gained access to their NIL (name-image-likeness).\nHercy Miller signed a $2 million sponsorship deal\nMiami striker Gilbert Frierson signed a deal with Lamelo Meat Market\nDan Lambert, a longtime Miami football fan, has offered each scholarship player (90 total) on the Miami football team a monthly payment of $500 to advertise his gyms on social media\nPotential No 1. Pick in the NFL draft, Kayvon Thibodeaux partnered with Nike founder Phil Knight to issue an NFT collection\nArkansas WR Trey Knox and his dog partnered with PetSmart\nThe student in collegiate athlete was always silent, but at least now the silence in exchange for (potentially) life-altering sponsorship deals rather than school pride.\nA New Era For Student-Athletes\nAnd this is only the beginning. FSU QB McKenzie Milton and Miami QB D'Eriq King founded Dreamfield a name-image-likeness platform focused on booking live events for student-athletes, including autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, and speaking engagements. Think of it as a collegiate athlete version of Cameo where fans can get access to top collegiate athletes who are now monetizing their time for thousands of dollars an hour. Whether this new regulation makes collegiate sports better or not (it will) is the incorrect question. The important question is how many athletes will be able to benefit from their unique and otherwise non-monetized success?\n\nNotably, most collegiate athletes will not be able to make significant revenue by selling their name or image (e.g. sponsorships). However, athletes with strong social media followings are set to capitalize on this new rule change. Young, culture-savvy athletes are well poised to leverage crypto primitives like NFTs and social tokens to monetize their brands and usher in a new era, the athlete creator economy.",

      "content": "As a teen, I spent weeks of my life playing Runescape. Weeks.\nSkilling Up\nIt appears uncommon, many individuals who are in crypto played Runescape, World of Warcraft, or some other MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game). The most common analogy derived from Runescape is of the infamous blue party hat as the original Runescape NFT and a representation of how useless items can have an immense monetary value. But, I’m not going to talk about Christmas cracker rewards (you’ll get this if you played the game, nerd) and instead discuss another aspect of the game which I believe crypto should draw from.\n\nRunescape was an amazing game for several reasons. The gameplay was fun as there was something to do for all types of gamers. It was social with groups (clans) and some tasks required multiple individuals to complete. And most importantly, it took fucking hours to do anything.\n\nIn Runescape, if you achieved level 99 (maxed out) one of the skills (i.e. farming, cooking, mining) then you received a skill cape.\n\nThere were two factors that made skill capes so desirable. First, they weren’t tradeable, you couldn’t buy your way to success. \n\nSecond, there wasn’t a supply cap on the number of skill capes that could exist – if you achieved 99 in the skill, you could buy one.\nNotably, skill capes in Runescape weren’t tradeable which increased their social value because obtaining a cape couldn’t be gamed.\n\nSource: OSRS\n\nMaxing out Runescape’s most time-intensive skill, Slayer – killing special monsters – requires a minimum of 300 hours of gameplay. That’s equivalent to 12.5 days of nonstop playing or 37.5 workdays (8 hours each day). Even the lowest time-intensive skill in Runescape – Prayer – demands at least 8.5 hours of gameplay to reach the top level. When a player in Runescape wears a skill cap, it means they grinded out some stat for days or weeks.\n\nI bring up Runescape because skill capes are an example of scarcity through time and labor.\nTime Scarce NFTs\nTime is universal and naturally limited making it the most equitable resource – everyone has the same 24 hours. NFTs can take a page from the Runescape playbook by integrating time or labor-intensive tasks into how they are earned. To date, acquiring most NFTs simply requires capital, creating an NFT culture built around money as opposed to merit.\n\nNFTs imbued with a culture of grinding breeds a community based on shared experience. Time scare NFTs don’t necessarily have to be labor-intensive. Zapper’s NFTs required habitually checking their application every day to receive experience points to reach certain levels where NFTs were rewarded.\n\nThe magic of software is that there can be all types of experiments:\nNFTs/badges rewarded for performing several habitual tasks in a DAO (e.g. voting)\nNon-tradeable NFTs awarded based on skill or effort (e.g. NFTs for people who hold over X amount NFTs from verified OpenSea contracts)\nNon-tradeable NFTs that require being created from acquiring non-tradeable subparts( also NFTs)\nNon-tradeable NFTs that permit access to other NFTs which are tradeable are  don’t have\nThe design space is wide open for new types of NFTs and DAOs and communities that adopt time-scarce NFTs might experience stronger communities that aren’t solely financial in nature.\n\n",

      "title": "The Double Edge Sword of Exclusivity ",
      "content": "I recently read an excellent Mirror post from Gaby Goldberg, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners.\nThe Social Token Paradox: Diminishing Returns to New Nodes\nIn the essay, Goldberg discusses what she calls the “Social Token Paradox” – a problem that arises within social tokens communities based on exclusivity. The challenge is that social tokens need to appreciate by including new members and yet these membership gated communities must keep their groups exclusive otherwise the social and utility value will decrease. Thus, the social token paradox is born.\n\nBarring utility growth in other forms, exclusivity-based communities face the Social Token Paradox and are destined to repeat a vicious cycle:\nPhase 1: An exclusivity-based community is build using a social token whereby membership requires possessing a certain number of tokens.\nPhase 2: Early entrants to the group acquire tokens and therefore the token appreciates. New entrants also reinforce the idea that the group is exclusive and socially valuable and therefore the exclusivity increases for a time.\nPhase 3: At some threshold (depending on the group) the continued growth of new members starts to decrease the social utility and exclusivity of the group. However, the token price rises as new members are forced to acquire tokens.\nPhase 4: Ultimately new members are incentivized to recruit new members to ensure that the token appreciates. However, at a large enough size, new members result in diminishing returns for exclusivity value. At this point, the token appreciates and peaks at some member headcount.\nPhase 5: Members sell the token for profit or because of decreased exclusivity/utility. Eventually, the community reaches some equilibrium before continuing the cycle again.\n\nThis paradox does not occur with non-membership-based tokens. For example, each new buyer of Bitcoin adds value – increases the scarcity – of Bitcoin and therefore all members are aligned. New nodes or members to the network increase the value of the network.\nThe Double Edge Sword of Exclusivity\nUnfortunately, there are diminishing returns to growing an exclusive community. More people generally means less exclusivity and therefore less social value. Membership in exchange for monetary value is the most common form of exclusivity. Country clubs, events, and subscriptions are all forms of exchanging monetary value for exclusivity.  Some aspects of membership are fleeting (e.g. events) while others are recurring (e.g. membership dues).\n\nFinancially-derived exclusivity or membership is a double edge sword – it will succumb to the social token paradox. It naturally limits the size and potential growth of a community.\n\nExclusivity as a value proposition will always exist but it doesn’t have to be wholly financially dependent.\nPerformance or Accomplishment Exclusivity\nAccomplishment or performance is a socially valuable signal. Oftentimes performance can be vague to assess, however, Rabbithole has already started to create on-chain records for completing certain tasks. Additionally, membership can be given to individuals who have completed tasks in various DAO (e.g. bronze members, silver members, etc.) or previous voters. Tiered membership based on accomplishments or participation can bring together individuals from different communities into a single DAO or community. Imagine having some of the top contributors or voters from various DAOs all in one single DAO.\nTime Exclusivity\nCreating membership based on time can align long-term players and adds an element that cannot be gamed or financially purchased. Time membership can also be combined with accomplishments such as tasks that involved grinding away at some task for hours or weeks until it is achieved. This model can incentivize the development of communities that require significant effort to join.\nExperience or Service Exclusivity\nShared experience unites various individuals whether it be fraternities, college students, people in the same geolocation, or otherwise. Experiences can also be cause-oriented such as charitable affiliates or event-oriented by requiring individuals to attend an artist’s concert before getting an NFT that provides access to their discord channel.\nFinal Thoughts on Exclusivity\nThis isn't to say that financial exclusivity is negative – how people chose to allocate their capital whether it be on activities, memberships, or otherwise is all about tradeoffs. Exclusivity brings value to communities based on a shared purpose or goal. As social token communities seek to expand their networks, it will be vital to imagine ways to bring utility and value that aren’t only financial in nature.\n",

      "title": "Blitzscaling DAOs: Rethinking spending for decentralized organizations",
      "content": "\n\n  What if, with the power of modern information technology, we can encode the mission statement into code; that is, create an inviolable contract that generates revenue, pays people to perform some function, and finds hardware for itself to run on, all without any need for top-down human direction? - Vitalik Buterin, 2013\nWell 19-year old Vitalik, I’ll tell you since the age of DAOs is upon us.\n\nNo longer are jurisdiction-less digital organizations, capable of generating real economic activity merely ideas. Eight years later, we have hundreds of these digital organizations, consisting of thousands of people and billions of dollars of capital, demonstrating in real time how the future of work is being reinvented. What began as theory has now transformed into a burgeoning, multifaceted ecosystem of DAOs all operating with their own respective missions.\n\nPretty incredible if you ask me.\n\nSource: Cooper Turley: DAO Landscape\n\nWhile we’re seeing these grand experiments play out in front of our eyes, it’s worth noting that even though DAO’s are a new, innovative means of organizing productive work, they are by no means completely reinventing the wheel. Since the dawn of time, humans have explored numerous ways of aggregating capital, allocating that capital, coordinating tasks, compensating workers, etc. This has taken many forms but it eventually culminated in the familiar corporate structure we know today. It’s no accident that we coalesced around the firm as the main vehicle with which to drive economic activity either. It’s an effective means to coordinate large groups of people around a common goal.\n\nGiven that DAOs are essentially the next iteration of the firm, albeit in a more digitally native, decentralized fashion, there are a number of lessons to be learned from analyzing the ways in which we’ve built and grown successful businesses. There are legions of books, podcasts, online courses, MBA’s, you name it, covering this topic. But there’s one that appears highly relevant in the context of DAOs.\nIn their current state, despite sitting on massive warchests, DAOs are spending very conservatively. This is hampering growth and leaving them vulnerable to competition that could spend their way to scale faster and come to dominate their respective vertical.\n\nDAOs need to take a page from the startup playbook: Blitzscaling.\n\nBlitzscaling 101\nBlitzscaling is a concept popularized by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman in his book bearing the name. To summarize:\n  Blitzscaling is a strategy and set of techniques for driving and managing extremely rapid growth that prioritize speed over efficiency in an environment of uncertainty. Put another way, it’s an accelerant that allows your company to grow at a furious pace that knocks the competition out of the water.\nRather than spending with careful, calculated precision, Blitzscaling emphasizes growth above all else even if it means sacrificing efficiency.\nWhy risk this tradeoff? Because the cost of moving too slowly is greater than the inefficiencies that come about as a result of rapid capital allocation. If you were to take your sweet time ensuring every dollar is put towards its most productive use, you are putting your organization at risk. A competitor could spend their way past you to a point where you can no longer compete. And by then, what good is a dollar saved if you’re out of business.\n\nThis strategy isn’t applicable to every business in any industry, however, it is in ones with high network effects where each marginal user makes the platform more valuable for the next. These industries tend to be winner-take-most after reaching escape velocity. An obvious example of this is the ride-sharing industry where as Uber was able to get more drivers it became more valuable for riders who then made it more profitable to drive and so began the virtuous cycle. For this reason, Uber now owns nearly 70% of all U.S. rideshare business as they were able to get to a certain scale. And do so quickly.\n\nCrypto, like ridesharing, is an industry that meets this precondition of high network effects. Take Uniswap, the largest DAO by treasury size. As each additional user begins to trade, it becomes more profitable to provide liquidity so LPs bring in more capital which then makes it more attractive to trade as price execution improves and there you have your virtuous cycle. As the first AMM to reach scale competitive with centralized exchanges, Uniswap has occupied this Uber-like position… at least for now. Where the analogy breaks down is that ride-sharing has become ubiquitous across the world while DeFi still operates in its fringe corner of the financial world. This makes it far too early to call any winners.\n\nAdding to why it's not yet a foregone conclusion that any of this industry’s leaders will continue to lead, is that crypto is uniquely hypercompetitive due to its open-source nature. Any application is susceptible to a copy and paste, making it even more urgent for DAOs to get to scale quickly.\n\nContinuing with this decentralized exchange example, the rise of Sushiswap makes it clear that forks can develop into ecosystems of their own and become viable threats. Even though SushiSwap remains a far second behind Uniswap, it’s evident that the omnipresent threat of forking presents a legitimate concern for any project.\n\nThis is not to say there aren’t \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/defi-citadels-how-defi-protocols-create-and-capture-value\"\u003emoats\u003c/a\u003e preventing incumbents from being immediately usurped. There’s brand, community, and integrations, just to name a few. As a DAO scales each of these up, they become increasingly protective. Therefore, the faster a protocol grows, the less likely it is to be prone to competition.\n\nThe DAO Spending Problem\nWe’ve established that DAOs need to grow quickly in order to capitalize on the network effects inherent in crypto and to avoid competition reaching scale first. So what are they doing to achieve this?\nOver the past year, the 3 largest DAOs have established grant programs to begin funding value add activities. This has provided ~$3 million to numerous different people and organizations that are helping to build better tools, integrate with more protocols, provide more data and research, host events, and more.\n\nEach respective grant program has produced a number of great outcomes allocating the funds they’ve received. We’ve had initiatives directly bring in hundreds of users, treasury dashboards to provide better insight into project finances, and even Esports sponsorships increasing brand awareness! This is all well and good, but could DAOs be doing more in an effort to further bolster growth?\nThe answer is a resounding yes.\n\nThe current allotted funds for grant programs don’t even make a drop in the bucket. It’s a fraction of a fraction of a drop. Now this is somewhat of a myopic view as grant programs don’t encapsulate the entirety of a DAOs spending. Treasuries are separately being used to fund core contributors, incentivize liquidity, and even establish legal activist funds. But the point remains. The vast majority of DAOs are sitting idly on large treasury balances that could otherwise be used for growth. Which as you recall, is necessary in this type of industry, otherwise, another more eager project could come along and spend their way to scale achieving an insurmountable lead thanks to inherent network effects.\n\nDAO Shall Blitzscale or Die Trying\nIt’s evident DAOs can (and should) be doing more to spend. Even if they remain conservative and begin allocating low single digit percent of their treasury towards grant programs, it would go a long way in terms of what they could accomplish by way of more users, value locked, revenue generated, all culminating in a more valuable organization.\n\nIf DAOs spent 0.5% to 1% of their treasury they’d be able to scale the number and scale of the initiatives they fund by an order of magnitude. This means more and better capitalized organizations building, researching, marketing, and doing all sorts of value-add services to help DAOs grow.\n\nTaking it to a more aggressive and yet still reasonable level of 10% of the treasury, and now you have a force to be reckoned with. Furthermore, this still gives a DAO 10 years to spend their entire treasury. That’s at least a few centuries in crypto time.\n\nGiven the exponential growth of the industry, it certainly feels like we are at a major turning point and there could only be a relatively small window in which projects have the chance to make a name for themselves. By spending 9 figures, DAOs would put themselves in a position to do some serious damage when it comes to bringing them to the forefront of not just crypto but the entire world.\n\nBut what could a project possibly spend $100 million, if not more, on? With a blitzscaling mentality there is no shortage of possible value add services to fund...\n\nFor starters, any reasonably competent team looking to build useful tooling could be funded. The ones that stand out as exceptional? Overfund them to ensure they have the resources necessary to build the most useful, user-friendly tools to enable your 90 year old grandma to become a proper degen.\n\nAnd to make sure she doesn’t get rugged, projects already pay for one of those ever so expensive smart contract auditors. But in fact, they could even pay for two. Hell why not make it three. DAOs should want to get as many eyes as possible on the inner workings of what could become the future plumbing of the global financial system. This would ensure the probability of a hack is as close to 0% as humanly possible to avoid something that could prevent the old world from ever taking you seriously enough to trust you with their money.\n\nRather than attracting mindshare from negative press like hacks, DAOs can focus on penetrating mainstream consciousness in more deliberate ways. Like putting their name on shit people pay attention to. Look at FTX. They are spending on everything from basketball stadiums to umpire uniforms to League of Legends teams. Sure they’re an $18 billion organization so they can afford to spend hundreds of millions on each of these deals but there are plenty of billion dollar DAOs that can cough up enough to sponsor a sports team. Or at the very least a Super Bowl commercial. Eyeballs are worth something and if you get a fanbase practically the size of the entirety of crypto looking at your name, you’ll start drawing in more people to at least check out what you’re doing.\n\nCredit where its due, $25 million is a lot of money that will go a long way towards combatting senile politicians in DC standing in the way of crypto gaining widespread adoption. But that’s just one project. Do you know what would be better? An industry wide $100 million. Or even $1 billion dollars. This may not directly benefit a DAO to get ahead of its direct competition but it’d stave off a far nastier form of competition. If enough projects join the ranks of Uniswap, and more recently projects like Yearn, Curve and Sushi, to fund more aggressive legal activism, we can make sure those in power know full well crypto is a force for good in making the world a more transparent, equitable world and that they’d be damned if they tried to regulate it out of existence.\n\nSpeaking of transparency, 10k’s and 10q’s are a thing of the past. We now have real-time balance sheets and P\u0026L’s to view the financial state of a protocol at any moment in time. However, we haven’t yet scratched the surface of what is possible. DAOs could be funding more SQL wizards so that they get every possible datapoint an interested party would want to know in a variety of clean, filterable dashboards. This wouldn’t just be transparent. This would be crystal clear, translucency into an organization that’s never been seen before. DAOs that fail to keep up will die out as the ecosystem will come to demand the gold standard of project reporting\n\nAnd furthermore, while these numbers are important, they are meaningless digits without proper context. Thankfully, there’s an army of analysts out there capable of taking these numbers and using them to tell a story about what they are and why they matter. With adequate research, DAOs can have not only their key decision makers well-informed, but they can keep the broader crypto community up to speed on all the material developments to attract more developers, investors, and users now armed with the right knowledge.\n\nI could go on but you get the point. There are many problems to solve but finding ways to spend money on useful things is not one. If a DAO wants to blitzscale it can.\n\nA few points to consider\nWith great power comes great responsibility. And handing tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to a grant committee certainly bestows quite a bit of power. In their current form, grant committees would not be equipped to handle this kind of responsibility. With this spending power, the DAO services economy would be thriving with all sorts of companies vying for grants which means the number of applications would skyrocket. Therefore, either the size of the committees would need to scale or you need to have more goal-specific programs (i.e. separate grants programs for product, marketing, research, etc). As the operations become increasingly complex, they’d need to develop into their own mini corporations in and of themselves which presents a whole host of additional problems to be solved.\n\nAnother issue to consider is that token holders may be averse to funding this type of spending program as it is funded in native tokens, yet recipients likely want stablecoins. This could make numbers go down if every grant gets market dumped. However, DAOs could implement vesting schedules where it makes sense or even get creative with more exotic means such as KPI options to prevent insta dumping. This would create a more distributed set of stakeholders all with a vested interest in the success of the DAO as a whole.\n\nThere are also “no net spend” ways to fund programs as we saw with Flipside’s latest proposal to essentially borrow $25 million in UNI to earn yield to fund data analytics. This would provide DAOs with a way to put their treasury to use without actually spending anything as they can always recall the grant in its entirety. This specific proposal failed as many stakeholders were seemingly blindsided and brought up valid concerns around its oversight. Regardless, this type of yield generating structure is a net benefit to all parties as service providers and the broader community can get paid for value-add services while DAOs simply put unproductive assets to work without having to deplete their balance sheet.\n\nThis report focused only on the outflow of money from a DAO but ignored potential inflows. Going back to thinking of DAOs as companies, the goal is not to burn money on the balance sheet but to generate revenue to fund ongoing expenses. Many of these projects are generating millions of dollars in revenue per year, and if they’re not now, they have the ability to flip the switch to turn on the revenue machine. With this kind of offsetting cash flow, the case for blitzscaling becomes even stronger as the burn rate for treasury funds decreases.\n\nConcluding thoughts\nBlitzscaling has become common parlance in Silicon Valley. Startups have come to learn that when there are strong network effects at play you are in a race against the clock. The largest companies today that pervade our everyday life: Amazon, Facebook, Uber, AirBnb, all understood that if they wanted to get to where they are now they would need to grow at an uncomfortable pace, defying the old tried and true old business logic.\n\n\\We are witnessing a similar phenomenon in crypto play out where the conditions appear to favor protocols that are able to achieve scale quickly. So far, DAOs have grown faster than the early proponents could have imagined. But they are still far from reaching their full potential. In the same way the advent of the firm allowed us to more efficiently organize resources to advance human progress, DAOs can unlock the next level of growth.

      "content": "The Olympics are always memorable. Even in the shadow of Covid-19, the 2020 (2021?) Olympic games have been full of incredible moments. Some are heartwarming. Others are funny. Few are soul-crushing. All tear jerking.\n\nHistory is made with each consecutive Olympic Games as existing athletes cement their legacies and new athletes push the boundaries of what humanity previously thought was possible. The Olympics are the great unifier. They bring the world’s most impressive individuals together to compete for something greater than themselves and inspire the next generation.\n\nOver the past several decades, the global sports industry has continued to expand in both popularity and the creation of new sports. In 2018, the global sports market was valued at approximately $471 billion, up nearly 50% since 2011. With the advent of the digital age, sports betting and adjacent related business (e.g. fantasy sports) have \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/fantasy-sports-crypto-s-next-consumer-application\"\u003egrown\u003c/a\u003e in parallel.\n\nCombining speculation with sports is a tried and true recipe and cryptonetworks with tokenized assets are the natural steroids for which the industry will use to reach new heights. To date, crypto-based sports applications have been incredibly successful. Non-fungible token sports applications have generated over $800 million in secondary sales and likely over $1 billion when factoring in primary sales.\n\nCrypto sports apps now account for three of the top ten non-fungible token applications and five of the top thirty. NBA Top Shot accounts for the majority of sports NFT sales and remains one of the most successful NFT applications overall. Over time, sports like Soccer – and the NFTs projects behind those sports like Sorare – boast larger potential markets.\n\nThese projects rely highly on partnerships and licensing agreements with professional sports organizations to use the image and likeness of athletes and sports teams. Notably, Zed Run – a digital horse racing game where NFTs represent individual horses – announced a partnership with NASCAR to develop a stock car auto racing game to grow a new fandom experience. As the companies – Dapper Labs (NBA Top Shot), Sorare, Virtual Human Studio (Zed Run) – grow their signature NFT brands, they will continue to evolve by expanding to other sports or building applications on top of their games (e.g. NBA Top Shot is developing a fantasy game called HardCourt).\n\nWhile total monthly sales have declined, Sorare and Zed Run have remained steady showing continued interest for NFT in sports-based applications. It’s possible that the functionality offered by Sorare and Zed Run NFTs – both are used for fantasy sports or racing – has resulted in their continued speculation while sole collectibles like Top Shot and Topps NFTs have experienced a decline in speculative fervor.\n\nBut, even though volume for NBA Top Shot slows, unique buyers have remained relatively strong with over 50,000 unique buyers each month since February. Following the NFT market peak, Topps MLB and F1 Delta Time have fallen behind in user growth and sales compared to Sorare, Zed Run, and NBA Top Shot.\n\nStill, crypto sports applications present one of the most obvious use cases for passionate fans to speculate on their favorite activities or transfer their gambling habits – like horse racing – from the physical realm into the digital.\n\nSports are a passion shared by billions of people around the world. Crypto sports don’t promise the same level of national pride, human achievement, and raw emotion that we witness in the Olympics. However, crypto sports apps will be widely integrated into our daily lives as individuals continue to search for ways to speculate on their passions.\n\n",

For the first time since the May crash, sectors experienced two-digit weekly returns, possibly marking the bottom of the recent multi-month decline. The leading sector this week was DeFi finishing the week with a whopping 23% return. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra\"\u003eTerra\u003c/a\u003e (+50.9%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/amp\"\u003eAmp\u003c/a\u003e (+76.62%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/thorchain\"\u003eTHORChain\u003c/a\u003e (+58.76%) were among the top-performing assets in the sector. The Currencies sector followed closely, posting a weekly of 22% driven entirely by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin’s\u003c/a\u003e performance (+22.8%).\n\nDespite having solid weekly returns, the DEX and Smart Contract Platform sectors were the two underperforming groups of the week. On the DEX side, performance was driven by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/uniswap\"\u003eUniswap\u003c/a\u003e (+9.05%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap\"\u003ePancakeSwap\u003c/a\u003e (+13.01%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/thorchain\"\u003eTHORChain\u003c/a\u003e (+58.76%), while the Smart Contract Platform sector was boosted by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e (+14.9%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/polkadot\"\u003ePolkadot\u003c/a\u003e (+14.4%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/solana\"\u003eSolana\u003c/a\u003e (+8.2%).\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\nThe market-weighted “sector portfolios” for this week’s report were created by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of July 29th.\n\nSector Drill Down\nPerformance during the week ending July 29th has been the best in recent months. All sector portfolios had a phenomenal week propelled by a sudden change in market sentiment. For the first time since May, DeFi activity is showing signs of life once again with DEX trading volumes increasing and outstanding loans across major lending platforms reaching new all-time highs.\n\nDuring the week, all sector portfolios followed the pattern every investor is excited to see: up and to the right. In the early days of the week, performance between the portfolios was relatively tight, with DEXs and DeFi leading the way. However, as the week came to a close, portfolio returns began to show higher levels of dispersion. In the end, the Currency portfolio outperformed the rest, finishing with a 23.4% return aided by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin’s\u003c/a\u003e strong weekly performance (+22.8%). The DeFi portfolio came in a close second place. Despite having solid performers like \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra\"\u003eTerra\u003c/a\u003e (+50.9%) and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/thorchain\"\u003eTHORChain\u003c/a\u003e (+58.76%), the DeFi portfolio has a heavy allocation to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/uniswap\"\u003eUniswap\u003c/a\u003e (+9.05%), which didn’t perform as well as other DeFi assets.\n\nThe Smart Contract Platform and Web3 portfolios were the two laggards of the group ending with weekly returns of 14.6% and 16.8%, respectively.\n\nVolatility, measured as the rolling standard deviation of the portfolio’s daily log returns, has seen a few spikes but is on a clear downward trend. Notably, since the May crash, each new peak has been lower than the previous one, showing increased market stability. Compared to levels in mid-May, current portfolio volatility is relatively low.\n\nWeek-over-week, the correlation between sector portfolios and Bitcoin saw a bit of a decline. In particular, the Smart Contract Platforms, DEX, and DeFi portfolios saw their correlation dropped 4-7% over the week. The Web3 portfolio is the only exception moving relatively flat over the past seven days.\n\nRegarding correlation with Ethereum, sector portfolios continue to see their correlation steadily declining over the past several weeks. In particular, the Currency portfolio (which is heavily allocated to Bitcoin) has seen the most significant decline going from 88% to 80% since Mid-July.\n\n",

Within the sector, platforms like Ethereum (+5.31%), Polkadot (+0.93%), and Ethereum Classic (+0.41%) were the main drivers of the sector’s 7D performance.\n\nOn the opposite side, the Web3 sector didn’t experience the same rebound as the rest of the sectors, finishing the week with a -3.47% loss. Although most assets in the sector had negative-to-muted weekly returns, the vast majority of the sector’s underperformance can be attributed to four assets: Filecoin (-2.30%), The Graph (-7.43%), BitTorrent (-5.70%), Stacks (-15.28%).\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\nThe market-weighted “sector portfolios” for this week’s report were created by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of July 22nd.\n\nSector Drill Down\nPerformance during the week ending on July 22nd was a bit of a rollercoaster. All sector portfolios started the week with disappointing performance with some reaching lows of -10% to -20% in the first five days of the week. However, performance across the board improved starting on July 20th gaining back some of the previous day’s losses. On July 21st, the overall market was boosted by comments from Elon Musk saying that his companies (Tesla and SpaceX) hold Bitcoin, while his personal holdings include a good amount of Ethereum and (of course) Dogecoin.\n\nThe Smart Contract sector portfolio ended the week with the least losses across all sector portfolios. Despite Ethereum’s positive benefit, the sector portfolio’s overall performance was dragged down by assets like Cardano and Solana. The runner-up was the Top Assets portfolio which ended the week with a -1.7% mostly driven by Bitcoin’s performance over the week.\n\nThe Web3 portfolio suffered the most losses ending the week with a -8% return. The biggest losers within the sector include Arweave (-15.5%), Storj (-15.8%), and LivePeer (-18.2%).\n\nVolatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, had been on a steady decline since the beginning of July. However, in the past two days, there was a small uptick as a consequence of the recent rally. Compared to levels in mid-May, volatility is relatively low.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolios are currently the ones with the highest risk both running 10-day rolling volatility of ~7%. The volatility of the Top Asset and Currency portfolios has been moving in the 4-6% due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin which has been one of the least volatile assets relative to the rest of the tokens covered in the report.\n\nThe correlation between sector portfolios and Bitcoin saw a sudden jump over the week as a result of the market upswing. Aside from the portfolios that are heavily allocated to Bitcoin (Top Assets and Currency portfolios), all sector portfolios have a correlation with Bitcoin greater than 80%.\n\nOn the contrary, the correlation with Ethereum has been on a steady decline. Particularly, the Web3 portfolio went from having a correlation of over 95% in the early days of June to ~85% currently. DEXs and DeFi also saw a decline of roughly 7% over the same period.\n\n",

      "title": "The Nature of Venture",
      "content": "The nature of venture capital is changing. While the venture capital industry has origins dating back to the 19th century, the concept exploded in the 1960s after the successful backing of semiconductor startup, Fairchild Semiconductor. While capital – the ability to source millions of dollars – was initially the primary source of value, access to capital has become increasingly commoditized. \n\nThe maturation of the internet and the advent of crypto only further accelerated the commoditization of capital with the ability to easily distribute information and transfer value, respectively. As the crypto industry matures, the venture industry is finding its footing unbalanced as venture capitalists experience the rug being pulled out from underneath them. These are the warning signs of venture’s next evolution.\nThe Canary\nLooking back, PoolTogether –\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-path-to-becoming-a-global-lottery-juggernaut?utmsource=MasonNystrom\u0026utmmedium=lede-tweet\u0026utmcampaign=lotteryjuggernaut\"\u003e the no-loss lottery protocol\u003c/a\u003e – acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine for what was to come in future crypto funding rounds. PoolTogether Improvement Proposal 11 aimed to raise $7 million for the PoolTogether protocol in exchange for 5.38% of the total \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/pooltogether\"\u003ePOOL\u003c/a\u003e supply. The strategic round would include a few venture funds receiving tokens at a 35% discount with a one-year lock up, followed by one-year weekly vesting (effectively two years until fully distributed). The community was upset. In May the market was still frothy (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eETH\u003c/a\u003e trading at ~$3,000) but POOL was trading rather sideways and the PoolTogether community felt as if they were getting a raw deal, with most of the community members unable to participate.\n\nSince the strategic round was relatively small and there were only four venture funds included in the round, the community and VCs were able to come to an amicable agreement, in large part because of PoolTogether founder Leighton Cusack who was able to liaison a better deal (PIPT-13) for the community. The new deal reduced the deal size to ~$6 million with a 30% discount, brought in Maven Capital, a European-based VC who committed to depositing working capital into PoolTogether’s protocol. In the end, the PoolTogether community spent 76% of the token allocation from the first deal (24% savings rate) while receiving 85% of original capital (a loss of only 15%). The PoolTogether community’s ability to push back and force VCs to the negotiation table demonstrates the shifting power dynamics of open, liquid cryptonetworks.\n\nBut, alas, the warning signs only grow.\nThe First Tremor\nSushiSwap, a decentralized Exchange with nearly $3 billion more capital locked in its protocol than PoolTogether has elevated PoolTogether’s experience in funding, community backlash, and entertainment.\n\nFor context, Sushiswap is similarly conducting a strategic round from its treasury to a group of venture investors.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/0e1efa64-e808-48c0-a075-43a9550b450e\"\u003eSource: Messari\u003c/a\u003e\n\nYou can read the whole thread if you want, but you’ve been warned.\n\nThe deal terms:\nDeal size: $60m (25% of Developer Treasury) with up to 10m allocated to community members.\nVesting: 6-month cliff followed by 18-month linear vesting\nDiscount of 20-30%\nSushiSwap’s round was to be co-led by Pantera and Lightspeed Venture Partners, the latter of which placed one of the best VC bets of all time. Even with a portion of the round allocated to the community, individuals were still upset. In the over 268 comments left, many are from community members sharing how the discount is unfair, the round too large, the vesting schedule too short, and the value proposition vague.\n\nMany of the venture funds including both co-leads responded to the criticism explaining the reason for the discounts and the value that venture funds can bring to fishy DEX. (Lightspeed initial response, Pantera).\n\nGenerally speaking the top reasons for why venture funds can provide value include:\nGet working or growth capital\nUse the VC's connections and relationships\nSignaling (brands help)\nOther advice, support, guidance\nEncourage other portfolio companies to partner with the protocol\nSecure other long term partners, including partners in the traditional financial realm\nGenerally speaking, in both the PoolTogether and Sushi strategic rounds, venture funds advocate that discounts are fair because of the capital lockup and the value these funds can provide to the protocols. However, even as funds in the Sushi forum explained how the capital lock-up deserved the discount and aligned long-term incentives, members of the Sushi remained unconvinced that all 20 funds would equally provide the same value or that the short lock-up would equate to long-term players.\n\nThe Sushi community’s intuition that not all funds would be long-term players was somewhat accurate. Defiance Capital immediately started selling (you know, in order to be better long-term investors and all) which was quickly noticed by Twitter. Notably, DeFiance responded, stating that they have a fiduciary responsibility to sell tokens and that their actions don’t need to be explained to the public.\n\nStill, I wholeheartedly believe that venture funds can provide value when interests are long-term aligned. FutureFund spent a few million on the “sushi.com” domain for SushiSwap. SBF and Alameda have been long supporters of Sushi from the beginning. Other VCs are great at recruiting, sourcing deals, and connections are more important than people realize. But this value is often “soft” – interpersonal – rather than “hard” – actual technical development work – and as such is hard to communicate.\n\nThe Sushi Community is understandably upset, a bunch of VCs swoop in for a sweet 30% discount with a 15-month lockup. Most Sushi community members would probably take that deal!\n\nThankfully, the venture investors heard the outrage and responded accordingly. SBF posed good solutions including 2x lockup which justifies the discount and long-term incentives. Amy Wu from Lightspeed agreed to remove the discount and extend the lockup.\nAll seemed calm and headed towards a resolution, until Jeff Dorman entered the chat.\n\nJeff’s investment management firm, Arca, is long fish coin. It holds 7.5% of the xSUSHI supply, all purchased on the open market. Arca countered the strategic round proposal with an offer to purchase up to $10 million \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap\"\u003eSUSHI\u003c/a\u003e at a 30% premium to the current price on July 16th. The firm claims that  SUSHI trades below its fair market value and as such shouldn’t be selling a large percentage of the treasury. Additionally, the counter offer proposed that SushiSwap wasn’t in need of $60 million and instead, that $10 million should be more than enough to use for operations or deploy as stablecoins into the protocol.\n\nThere hasn’t been an update on the new proposal or any insights into whether both proposals will be equally considered (given that large individual token holders will likely determine the outcome). Still this situation is unprecedented and has sent shockwaves throughout Crypto Twitter resulting in a story with as many twists and turns and financial absurdity as a Money Stuff newsletter (here's your next subject, Matt Levine!) How the SushiSwap strategic round unfolds is still up in the air and regardless of what happens to SushiSwap, the takeaway is that the game is changing.\nThe Future of Venture\nIt's a testament to the power of crypto networks that world-renowned VCs like Lightspeed now have to approach the community for a fundraising round. The community has negotiated on behalf of their protocol, and it appears as if the strategic round will now increase the lockup while reducing the 30% discount. That’s value add from the Sushi community.\n\nUltimately the right decision – on whether to take venture funding and respective deal terms – changes with each protocol. Some protocols can more effectively use capital which means that raising more stablecoins will be useful. Other teams might want to pair with venture funds they know will deliver value like Paradigm or favor funds that will only back one horse in the race.\n\nVenture can provide mercenary capital or value, and reputation will be a competitive advantage for venture funds. Some funds will nuke their reputations over single deals (after all, there’s still money to be made) while long term players will thrive with the additional publicity that comes from blockchains. VCs will increasingly face pressure from communities when they get cushy deals that don't come with significant lockups or funds will have to prove the value they bring is worth the discount.\n\nThe warning signs of the venture capital industry’s natural evolution are becoming more frequent. The deals are less private. The funding rounds are more competitive. The people are more powerful.\n\nUltimately, venture funds aren't going away, however, the nature of venture is changing.",

Of the 35 assets with over six unique venture or hedge fund investors, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/radicle\"\u003eRadicle\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/lido-dao\"\u003eLido DAO\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/oasis-labs\"\u003eOasis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dodo\"\u003eDODO\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/balancer\"\u003eBalancer\u003c/a\u003e maintain the lowest circulating market capitalization. Interestingly, Lido DAO is one of three assets in the derivatives sector (also \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/perpetual-protocol\"\u003ePERP\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/synthetix\"\u003eSNX\u003c/a\u003e) within the top-funded asset list while Radicle is one of the only Web3 projects reflected within the most funded list, besides The Graph and Orchid. Still, it’s important to note that circulating market cap can sometimes be misleading and it’s important to consider the fully diluted value of these assets. Tokens with high fully diluted valuations need to be able to grow into their valuations.\n\nOne trend worth noting is that venture investors clearly see large total addressable markets within the smart contract space and DEX landscape as they are the most frequently invested sectors within the top-funded assets.\n\nAdditionally, it appears that most funds appear to be under-exposed to Web3, NFTs, and more emergent sectors like the metaverse. This gap in exposure presents a potential opportunity as more investments could flow into these sectors in the coming 6-12 months. It’s also possible that these funds are already invested in these sectors and that those positions are illiquid or in projects that have yet to launch tokens and thereby not reflected in this analysis.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Investing Like a Crypto Fund\nInvesting like a crypto fund – venture or hedge – has never been easier. An average investor can quite literally copy-trade these portfolios and mirror any of their favorite funds. But, while copy-trading a prominent VC might appear at face value to be a good strategy, it’s important to remember that non-accredited or professional investors still don’t have equal access.\n\nMost of these funds typically receive private placements at far cheaper valuations, and the short-term focused funds are waiting to liquidate a portion of their tokens once vested to record profits for their investors. Further, during a bull market liquid assets – especially newer projects – often trade at a premium due to the expectation of a greater future valuation.\n\nWhile there are still barriers for individuals to invest in early-stage crypto projects, the opportunities are 10x better than the legacy financial world. The age of the everyday investor is dawning and crypto will be the primary avenue for growth.\nAs of Jul 1: Messari Fund Screener Spreadsheet\n",

      "title": "Q2'21 Layer-1 Review: A Peek at the Largest Ecosystems by TVL",
      "content": "Q1 2021 marked the beginning of the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/q1-2021-layer1-review-the-scaling-wars-have-arrived\"\u003elong-awaited ecosystem wars\u003c/a\u003e. With crypto markets continuing to attract mainstream attention, newfound retail entrants pushed Ethereum’s fees to all-time highs. The surge in demand was a net positive for the industry but rendered Ethereum unusable for most retail users, prompting them to look for alternative options since the beginning of the year. In conjunction with the deployment of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/ecosystem-of-ethereum-scaling-solutions\"\u003escaling solutions\u003c/a\u003e and the growth of the application ecosystems on adjacent Layer-1s like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), this exodus has become an important factor affecting Ethereum’s dominance in the space.\n\nQ2 2021 picked up where the previous quarter left off. The TVL flows over the last three months prove that Ethereum is still the belle of the ball, but it may not be the only party worth attending.\n\nTVL to the Moon\nIn a relatively short period of time, total value locked (TVL) in smart contracts went parabolic. Since October 2020, a mere seven months ago, assets flowing in different smart contract platforms increased tenfold from $10 billion (almost all locked in Ethereum) to over $100 billion across several scaling solutions and Layer-1s. The growth is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nWhile TVL growth is a strong indication of increasing user confidence and activity in DeFi protocols, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The metric is computed based on the USD denominated value of the tokens locked in smart contracts, so in many cases, an increase in TVL doesn’t necessarily mean more tokens are being deposited. An appreciation in token price is also a determining factor. Despite this shortcoming, TVL can be a useful statistic to compare the growth and adoption of different smart contract platforms since it provides a simple apples-to-apples comparison.\nThe Dawn of the “Ethereum Killer”\nAlthough the growth of the Layer-1 and Layer-2 sectors could ultimately benefit Ethereum, its dominance in the space is beginning to shrink. Of the $110 billion dollars in TVL, Ethereum controls roughly 77%, a drop of more than 20% when compared to its dominance five months ago.\n\nDespite the recent decline, Ethereum remains home to the most vibrant DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Since October of last year, TVL has ballooned from $11 billion to $85 billion (a 631% increase) as the yield-farming craze infected the crypto markets. The movement, catalyzed by Compound, acted as a propellant for the space as crypto users put more and more assets to work in various DeFi applications.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum’s DeFi sector has been the dominant destination for user funds. As of July 5th, roughly 47% of TVL is in six major DeFi protocols: Curve, Aave, MarkerDAO, Compound, Yearn, Uniswap, and SushiSwap. The other 53% is distributed across the remaining 169 applications tracked by DeFi Llama.\n\nBack in October 2020, TVL was mostly concentrated in Uniswap and MakerDAO, which accounted for approximately 43% of the value locked in Ethereum. However, the explosion of new financial primitives that began during DeFi Summer 2020 has whittled away at their dominance as investors moved assets searching for the next hot farming opportunity. This trend has continued throughout 2021, with long-tail applications now housing almost half of all TVL.\n\nThe Binance Smart Chain Rollercoaster\nIn the end, Ethereum’s success also became its burden.\n\nThe effects of Ethereum’s rising transaction fees started appearing in the first few months of 2021. Ethereum’s dominance began to decline as developers and users began to look for cheaper alternatives outside of the most popular blockchain. The first Ethereum challenger that began to experience meaningful traction as a result of Ethereum’s fee environment was Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nPropelled by a $100 million support fund and backed by the largest exchange in the world, BSC began to quickly expand its DeFi ecosystem, which featured direct copies of successful Ethereum-based applications. BSC’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/binance-enters-the-smart-contract-wars\"\u003eproximity to Ethereum\u003c/a\u003e in terms of building tools made it easy for developers to quickly iterate and deploy applications. On the user side, BSC’s compatibility with MetaMask lowered the barrier to entry for many Ethereum-native users creating a seamless transition between the two chains. These two catalysts in conjunction with extremely high token incentives led to a large influx of new users who sought cheap yield farming.\n\nBy the beginning of May 2021, BSC managed to capture $15 billion in total assets or approximately 13% of Ethereum’s TVL. PancakeSwap (DEX) and Venus (lending platform) are currently the two most successful applications and the ones that captured the highest amount of assets in the early days of 2021.\n\nBSC’s TVL has been quite the rollercoaster ride in Q2 2021. Soon after crossing the $15 billion mark, its TVL more than doubled to $35 billion in the span of ten days due to a wild price upswing for BNB and its spawn (like \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap\"\u003eCAKE\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/venus\"\u003eXVS\u003c/a\u003e). But the euphoria generated by the new all-time highs quickly vanished as a series of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-may-20th?referrer=category:all-research\"\u003enegative catalysts\u003c/a\u003e hit the market in mid-May, including a liquidation incident on Venus that lost $200 million and a flash loan attack on Pancake Bunny worth $45 million. The rise in exploits drained user confidence and sent token prices and TVL tumbling.\n\nAlthough TVL across all smart contract platforms contracted, BSC’s was particularly hurt given most of the value locked in its applications was mercenary capital and consisted of assets that had little use outside of incentivizing users. Unlike Ethereum's TVL, which has a healthy dose of stablecoins in the mix, the composition of BSC’s TVL was heavily skewed towards the higher end of the risk spectrum, making it extremely sensitive to market swings.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the early days of Binance Smart Chain, TVL was concentrated in two of its most successful applications: PancakeSwap and Venus. In October 2020, PancakeSwap was the leading application accounting for 60-70% of all the money flowing in the platform. The dynamic quickly changed when Venus entered the market in December 2020. The lending platform rapidly captured a significant portion of TVL cementing itself as the second-largest DeFi protocol in the BSC ecosystem.\n\nFrom December 2020 to April 2021, both protocols controlled around 90% of all the assets in the platform. In mid-April, as newer protocols launched, TVL began to spread out to other protocols like MDEX, Ellipsis Finance, and Wault. However, as of July 5th, PancakeSwap and Venus regained their dominant positions within the BSC ecosystem, controlling over 65% of the funds locked in smart contracts.\n\nPolygon’s Rise to Fame\nThe second platform that started chipping away at Ethereum’s TVL in April of 2021 was Layer-2 solution Polygon. Like BSC, Polygon took advantage of Ethereum’s high fee environment to bootstrap its application ecosystem by offering lower fees and faster transaction times. Polygon’s biggest advantage to date has been its compatibility with Ethereum, which lowered the learning curve for both users and developers. It is currently the third-largest chain in terms of TVL, handling 5% of all assets locked across all platforms.\n\nPolygon’s TVL went from less than $50 million to over $5 billion in Q2. This explosive growth was the result of two distinct factors. The first was the deployment of DeFi majors Aave, SushiSwap, and Curve. The protocols began exploring the scalability capabilities of Polygon at the beginning of Q2 2021 in an attempt to work around Ethereum’s congestion. Given their popularity and strong communities, it’s no surprise that the migration led to an uptick in user acquisition.\n\nThe second reason for the nearly exponential growth was the launch of Polygon’s DeFiforAll Fund. The team committed up to 2% of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/polygon\"\u003eMATIC\u003c/a\u003e’s total supply to continuously support the growth of its DeFi ecosystem over the next two to three years in the form of liquidity mining rewards across different applications. Unsurprisingly, the lion’s share of the rewards is currently going to users of the top DeFi applications in the ecosystem including Aave, Curve, and SushiSwap.\n\nAs a result, these three protocols account for nearly 65% of all value locked in Polygon. In particular, Aave’s market share of TVL exploded, going from less than 10% to 70% almost instantly due to its liquidity mining program.\n\nToken-incentivized user growth has become one of the most popular strategies used by protocols to bootstrap a community. This strategy, while efficient in the short term, can sometimes prove detrimental if it is not managed carefully. In many cases, the higher yields end up attracting mercenary capital from users who are looking to make a quick buck but have no vested interest in the long-term success of the project. In this kind of scenario, protocols are able to garner millions of dollars only to see it vanish when token incentives stop.\n\nWhile it might be too early to tell, this kind of user behavior is manifesting in Polygon’s largest applications. The three DeFi giants that account for more than $3 billion dollars of TVL are starting to see capital migrate back to Ethereum. In the case of Aave, which is the protocol offering the highest amount of liquidity mining incentives, it reached a point where TVL between Ethereum and Polygon was split 70% and 30% respectively. However, over the past two weeks, roughly 10% of Aave’s total TVL has made its way back to Ethereum.\n\nSushiSwap followed a similar pattern. TVL in Polygon began to grow at a rapid pace starting in May when the token incentives were announced. Consequently, SushiSwap’s TVL split between Ethereum and Polygon immediately went from 95% and 5% to 75% and 25%. Similar to Aave, the narrative changed over the past two weeks as Ethereum’s portion of TVL started to climb up.\n\nLastly, among the three protocols, Curve is the one that saw the least amount of funds flowing to its Polygon branch. Roughly 15% of Ethereum’s TVL migrated to Polygon over the course of six weeks right after the liquidity mining rewards were announced. In the same fashion as the previous two, Ethereum’s TVL started increasing in June as users flocked away from the side chain. After the recent relocation, Polygon’s share of Curve’s aggregate TVL shrunk from 15% to 7% in one month.\n\nThere are few potential reasons driving this kind of behavior. As mentioned earlier, the first one could be the result of users locking funds for a short period of time to take advantage of the exorbitant yields offered across the entire ecosystem. One piece of evidence supporting this point is the relationship between the number of incentives and the amount of TVL captured by Polygon.\n\nTo illustrate, Aave’s liquidity mining program was broken down into Phase 1 and Phase 2. During Phase 1, 1% of MATIC’s total supply (roughly $40 million at the time of writing) was allocated to Aave’s liquidity mining program. About 2 months later, Phase 2 was rolled out, extending the incentives program until January 17th, 2022, and increasing the rewards from $40 million to $85 million (assuming a MATIC price of $1.7 USD). As a result, and without much of a surprise, Aave experienced the most substantial inflow of assets among the three DeFi protocols. On the contrary, Curve’s liquidity mining program was a speck of Aave’s amount. The program, which launched on April 22nd, allocated a mere $6 million to match \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/curve\"\u003eCRV\u003c/a\u003e rewards over a 16-week window. Consequently, the amount of value that moved from Ethereum to Polygon in the case of Curve was relatively small.\n\nAnother reason for the retreat could be due to the asset composition of the two chains. Similar to BSC, if the assets locked in Polygon’s applications are riskier compared to the ones locked in Ethereum, then during market drawdowns the dollar value locked in Polygon will shrink relative to Ethereum. While this might be a possibility, it’s worth highlighting that most of the value fleeing to Ethereum through Polygon’s bridge is in \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/usd-coin\"\u003eUSDC\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nLastly, a third potential reason for Polygon’s ephemeral TVL could be due to Ethereum’s improving fee environment. The average gas fee per transaction has dropped down to December 2020 levels from levels as high as $30 dollars per transaction in mid-May. The drop can be attributed in part to the increased activity in adjacent smart contract platforms like Polygon and BSC.\n\nAlthough this could be one of the drivers behind the retreat, it’s hard to believe that users would simply go back to Ethereum due to lower fees. At the moment, Polygon’s liquidity mining programs are still active, meaning users can enjoy low-fee transactions while getting a boatload of rewards. From a utility maximization perspective, low fees in Ethereum shouldn’t be enough incentive to leave “free money” behind unless the market’s overall perception of Polygon has deteriorated in recent weeks.\nA Field of Dreams\nBSC and Polygon aren’t alone in this new multi-chain world. They’ve captured most of the attention outside of Ethereum so far by mimicking Ethereum’s development environment and end-user tooling, a growth hack that almost negates any switching costs. But the likes of Solana and Cosmos have gained traction despite their radically different designs.\nSolana Ecosystem\nSolana has optimized for speed over Ethereum compatibility. It uses a different virtual machine and several new approaches for managing transactions and state changes to achieve best-in-class transaction times. Solana’s speed enables it to support a new class of crypto use cases, such as the on-chain matching engine sported by Serum. But shoehorning Ethereum compatibility into Solana’s new environment has proven to be tricky and could be detrimental to performance. In response, the project has forgone the EVM route and relied on hackathons and funds like Alameda to incentivize developers to build on Solana in its current state.\n\nThese efforts have led to some early signs of success. Solana’s DeFi sector now has just under $1 billion in TVL, up around 4x since the start of Q2. This total is only a fraction of the assets locked in Ethereum, BSC, or Polygon due to the relatively small size of Solana’s current DeFi ecosystem (DeFi Llama tracks eight projects). But the network has an extensive pipeline of new financial products set to launch on or migrate to it over the coming months.\n\nIf Solana can continue to grow its developer base and application pipeline, its uniqueness may become a strength. Projects won’t be able to port their contracts and liquidity to secondary networks easily. With a burgeoning economy, an inherent developer lock-in, and plenty of funds to spare, Solana could become a popular platform for DeFi users to park their assets in the not-too-distant future.\nCosmos Ecosystem\nCosmos’ multichain DeFi ecosystem is gradually coming to life. Terra users locked over $2.2 billion worth of assets in its two applications, Mirror Protocol and Anchor Protocol, by the end of Q2. THORChain reached almost $140 million in liquidity in its first three months despite rolling out in a guarded launch. Kava also quietly accumulated $250 million in TVL (flat growth in Q2) across its lending protocol called HARD Protocol and built-in crypto-collateralized stablecoin system. Even upstart AMM platform Osmosis attracted almost $80 million in TVL within a few weeks of its mainnet launch.\n\nAside from Osmosis, these chains have operated independently of one another. A few have established bridges or on-ramps to external networks (Terra’s Shuttle Bridge to Ethereum and THORChain’s Bifrost gateways to several Layer-1s), but none have implemented \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/cosmos-ibc-unlocking-the-blockchain-multiverse\"\u003eIBC\u003c/a\u003e, the Cosmos ecosystem’s defining interoperability feature that allows these otherwise sovereign chains to communicate. Terra, Kava, and THORChain will likely change their IBC status before the end of 2021. But the question remains if the Cosmos Hub will be able to capture any of their asset flows by facilitating cross-chain transactions.\n\nThe only real case study for IBC transaction flows is Osmosis. It leveraged various IBC connections (and incentives) to bootstrap liquidity and trading quickly. While its launch led to an immediate spike in IBC activity across the Cosmos ecosystem, the ultimate beneficiary was Osmosis, not the Hub. If Cosmos’ more prolific zones create connections with each other instead of routing through the Hub, the Cosmos Hub may miss out on cementing itself as a central component of its self-titled ecosystem.\n\nAttracting capital flow is precisely why the recently released Gravity DEX will be critical to the Cosmos Hub’s long-term strategy. The exchange gives users a reason to deploy capital to the Hub or use it as a pit stop before moving to the next zone. It could also tie the Hub’s value to the ecosystem’s growth. If Gravity becomes the primary trading venue with the deepest liquidity pools within Cosmos, it could solidify the Hub as the center of the ecosystem’s economy, capturing fee revenue from each passerby.\nClosing Thoughts\nOne year ago, the concept of a multi-chain world was simply an abstract idea. Back then, the data available pointed at a single truth: Ethereum was the sole destination for DeFi applications. In the span of only six months, that truth has drastically changed.\n\nWe now live in a world where several blockchains outside of Ethereum have significant traction and a substantial amount of developer activity. While Ethereum may remain the focal point, it’s become undeniable that the cryptoeconomy will not reside in one single chain but will equal the aggregate economic activity taking place across many Layer-1s and scaling solutions.\n\nWhile attracting capital is a mandatory first step, these newer Layer-1s and scaling solutions must figure out how to retain new users. As indicated by the shift in dominance from BSC to Polygon in May, incentivized liquidity pools attract mercenary capital that will quickly exit when the hot ball of money finds a new home. Retaining capital will require networks to offer differentiated use cases and ancillary services that complement (and don’t cannibalize) existing applications.\n\nLearn more from Mainnet 2021\nWatch main stage programming from Messari's annual summit Mainnet 2021 to learn more about this exciting topic.

      "title": "Q2'21 DeFi Review",
      "content": "A little over a year ago Compound launched its COMP liquidity mining program and changed DeFi forever. With a new mechanism for bootstrapping liquidity in DeFi protocols, the sector has grown orders of magnitude across nearly every metric since. In the process it has not only captured the attention of investors, users, and regulators alike, but also demonstrated to the world clear signs of product market fit.\n\nQ2 2021 was a continuation of this momentum with most metrics reaching new all-time highs mid-way through the quarter. However, as broader crypto markets turned, DeFi was not immune. In many cases DeFi protocols saw activity decrease in the second half of the quarter as speculation in markets died down.\n\nBut is that all there is to the story?\n\nIn this report, we walk you through sector by sector, diving into key performance indicators, market developments, and key things to look out for in the quarters ahead. It was yet again a jam-packed quarter in the world of DeFi, and while asset prices may be depressed, DeFi fundamentals march on, providing the seeds of DeFi’s next leg of growth.\n\n\"DeFi is Mankind's Tower of Babel. We have rebuilt money as a language... a computer language that all cultures across all lands can speak. And now that all of our brilliance, greed, and ideals can be unified into one system, the system's growth will be unparalleled. The next 1-2 years will reverberate for decades and possibly centuries'' - Redphonecrypto\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nDecentralized Exchange Landscape\nDEX volumes continued their explosive growth in Q2 reaching $405 billion in the quarter – good for a 117x increase year-over-year and 83% increase since Q1. May alone accounted for over half the volume in the quarter, which unsurprisingly also marked the local top of the market.\n\nSince May, DEX volumes have halved, with June volumes falling to $95 billion. Still despite the decrease, the month was still the third highest all-time.\n\nZooming in on how the competitive landscape evolved throughout the quarter we see a pretty dramatic shift in PancakeSwap’s standing. While for a brief moment in April the breakfast themed DEX flipped Uniswap in volumes, since then its market share has plummeted due to the rise of Uniswap V3 and the fizzling out of the Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem following the May crash. By the end of the quarter Uniswap reached a 54% share of weekly volume, its highest level since November 2020.\n\nThe rise of Polygon also played a significant role in eating away Binance Smart Chain’s (BSC) share of decentralized exchange volumes. As the party shifted towards Polygon, with its new set of tokens to speculate on and farms to harvest, BSC was squeezed out of the picture. The activity provided a great glimpse into the developing liquidity wars between blockchains, showing that when token incentives are the primary reason why capital enters a blockchain ecosystem, it will also be the primary reason capital leaves when incentives fall or incentives are more attractive elsewhere.\n\nFinally, zooming out on the larger picture for DEXs, volumes as a percentage of centralized exchange (CEX) volumes surpassed 10% for the first time since October 2020. The data continues to show DEXs eating their centralized counterparts as time passes.\n\nQ2 Developments\nUniswap V3 Becomes the Top DEX\nIn May Uniswap finally \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/uniswap-v3-an-early-but-resounding-success\"\u003elaunched\u003c/a\u003e its highly anticipated Uniswap V3 protocol, with its crown feature of concentrated liquidity - the ability for liquidity providers (LPs) to make markets within customized price ranges, creating individual price curves in the process. The design promised to increase capital efficiency for LPs by as much as 4,000x by enabling LPs to provide the same liquidity depth as V2 within specified price ranges while leaving far less capital sitting idly. Within just weeks it became the top DEX in the industry and in June it facilitated nearly $28 billion in volume.\n\nUniswap V3 now accounts for more than 40% of all DEX volume and continues to eat the DEX market, showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nTHORChain Launches Multichain Chaosnet\nAfter more than two years of development and multiple delays, the cross-chain liquidity protocol \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/thorchain-infrastructure-for-a-multichain-future\"\u003eTHORChain\u003c/a\u003e finally went live in the first week of Q2. It is currently rolling out in a guarded launch, with the community progressively raising caps on liquidity pools as the network grows, proves out its security, and works through bugs. It currently supports five blockchains including Bitcoin, Etherum, Binance Chain, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin, with plans to connect with many more in the coming months. While volume so far has been muted due to the self-imposed caps on its pools, liquidity has grown in lockstep with cap raises showing clear market demand to provide cross-chain liquidity. With it increasingly becoming clear that we’re heading into a multi-chain future blockains like THORChain provide the much needed infrastructure to move value between blockchains without trusted third parties.\n\nPancakeSwap Fizzles Out\nThe BSC ecosystem was hit the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/q2-2021-layer-1-review-a-peek-at-the-most-active-smart-contract-platforms\"\u003eworst\u003c/a\u003e following the May market crash with TVL falling more than 50% from its peak in a matter of days. Although TVL across all smart contract platforms contracted, BSC’s was particularly hurt given most of the value locked in its applications was mercenary capital and consisted of assets that had little use outside of incentivizing user speculation. Unlike Ethereum’s TVL, which has a healthy dose of stablecoins in the mix, the composition of BSC’s TVL was heavily skewed towards the higher end of the risk spectrum making it extremely sensitive to market swings. Combined with a series of hacks and exploits on BSC leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, BSC saw speculation dry up dramatically in June leading to PancakeSwap volumes diving 69% in June. Its market share also plummeted in lockstep.\n\nLooking Forward\nRolling Up\nA common theme for all DeFi sectors moving forward will be the launch of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/ecosystem-of-ethereum-scaling-solutions?\"\u003elayer-2 scaling solutions\u003c/a\u003e on Ethereum that promise to scale DeFi by orders of magnitude without compromising on security. The most anticipated launches of these solutions are optimistic rollups which allow thousands of transactions to be bundled into a single rollup block. The leading solutions are Arbitrum and Optimism which are set to launch in Q3.\n\nDEXs in particular will benefit from scaling by no longer having to operate in a severely compute constrained environment, allowing them to focus more on capital efficiency. Uniswap V3 is the best example of this design philosophy. Although still an AMM, it has begun to approximate more of an order book in pursuit of capital efficiency. With Uniswap V3’s early success, there will be many potential activities unlocked through this scalability, and the recent uptick in activity on Polygon provides a glimpse of the  emerging future for layer-2s adoption.\n\nCross-Chain Liquidity\nOne of the outstanding questions surrounding Ethereum’s rollup-centric future is around the battle between L2  L1 and L2  L2 liquidity. As it stands today, users face long withdrawal periods when withdrawing liquidity from rollups to Ethereum, and have no way to move liquidity between rollups without first withdrawing to Ethereum. There are a number of proposed solutions including MakerDAO’s Optimism Dai Bridge which will allow users to lock up L1 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\"\u003eDAI\u003c/a\u003e to mint L2 oDAI. Once fast withdrawals are enabled later this year, oDAI may be burned in exchange for near-instant access to L1 DAI allowing users to escape the one week lockup period associated with Optimism.\n\nSource: MakerDAO Blog\n\nAs for more generalized solutions, Connext and Hop Protocol offer users the ability to move value between various L2s using a network of nodes to front liquidity to users on their destination chains. They promise to allow users to cheaply and quickly move value between L2s without sacrificing on security as well as allowing users to forgo long and expensive L1 transactions. While these protocols are very much in their early stages, they will no doubt play a key role in Ethereum’s rollup-centric future.\n\nLending Platforms\n\nLending Landscape\nAfter a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/q1-2021-defi-review-defi-booms-as-bull-market-heats-up?referrer=category:defi\"\u003ebooming Q1\u003c/a\u003e, the lending sector found itself cooling off during Q2. The first half of the quarter, however, was a continuation of the momentum from the previous quarter. From March up until the May crash lending deposits ballooned from $25 billion to a peak of $45 billion (an 81% jump in just six weeks) as investors sought to capture the exorbitant lending yields available across all lending protocols. However, the party came to a sudden halt as the market turned \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-may-20th?referrer=category:all-research\"\u003ebelly up\u003c/a\u003e. Motivated by the mounting market turbulence, investors flocked to safer assets triggering a collapse in lending deposits which completely erased the previous week’s growth. In the end, the total amount of assets locked across the major lending platforms increased a mere 15% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the number of outstanding loans followed a similar pattern. During the first six weeks of Q2, the total amount of outstanding loans increased 62%. However, unlike lending deposits, the decline following the market crash was not as drastic. In total, the collapse amounted only to $4 billion, or 21% from the top, in the following ten days. By the end of the quarter, the aggregate amount of outstanding loans increased approximately 44% over the quarter.\n\nAdditionally, supply yields across all lending platforms collapsed as investor’s borrowing demand dwindled. In the span of three months, lending rates for stablecoins, in particular \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/usd-coin\"\u003eUSDC\u003c/a\u003e, dropped nearly 85% from an average rate of 9.6% to 1.4%.\n\nSource: LoanScan\nQ2 Developments\nAave Joins The Multi-Chain World\nTowards the end of the first quarter of 2021, Aave announced the launch of its Polygon branch in an effort to escape Ethereum’s high fee environment. Following the announcement, Polygon and Aave teamed up to offer early users liquidity mining incentives to incentivize usage as part of Polygon’s DeFiForAll campaign. The program turned out to be a resounding success causing Aave’s TVL to double from $6 billion to $12 billion within two weeks of the announcement.\n\nPropelled by the Polygon launch and the heavy token incentives, Aave’s market share of total outstanding loans spiked in April giving Compound a run for its money. By the end of May, Aave dethroned Compound to become the leading lending platform capturing over 37% of DeFi’s aggregate lending market.\n\nBridging the Gap Between Crypto and Traditional Banking - Compound Treasury\n\nAt the end of the quarter, Compound Labs announced the launch of Compound Treasury, a product designed for non-crypto businesses and financial institutions that wish to tap into crypto’s interest rate markets. The company partnered with Fireblocks and Circle to create a product that allows organizations to access the USDC interest rates available on Compound without needing to worry about crypto-related intricacies such as private key management and crypto-to-fiat conversions. The product guarantees a fixed interest rate of 4% per year on deposits - an astronomical amount compared to the average U.S. saving account.\n\nLooking Forward\nLaying the Lending Foundation For The Multi-Chain World - Compound Gateway\nAs a multi-chain future becomes increasingly apparent, incumbent lending protocols have begun to explore solutions to adapt to this new way of operating. Compound’s approach revolves around the release of a stand-alone blockchain called \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/compound-s-gateway-to-the-future\"\u003eCompound Gateway\u003c/a\u003e as a way to embrace this emerging paradigm. Gateway is a Substrate based blockchain intending to serve as the infrastructure for cross-chain interest rate markets. Similar to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/thorchain-infrastructure-for-a-multichain-future\"\u003eTHORChain\u003c/a\u003e’s THORFi lending feature (set to launch later this year), Gateway’s goal is to provide users with the ability to borrow assets native to one chain (i.e Ethereum) with collateral from a different chain (i.e Solana).\n\nIn a nutshell, Gateway enables blockchain interoperability by using a type of connector contract called Startport as the core mechanism to connect and transfer value between different chains. Starports exist as contracts on peer ledgers (such as an Ethereum smart contract) and have the ability to lock assets until they are released by a Gateway validator node.\n\nSource: Compound\n\nAs of March 1st, Gateway is running as a testnet, connected to Ethereum’s Ropsten testnet.\n\nDeFi’s New Frontier - Fixed Income Markets\nWhile the fixed income space is still a nascent niche in DeFi, it is an enormous market in the traditional world. In this context, a fixed income product refers to any instrument that generates a steady and predictable stream of cash flows such as corporate bonds, treasury bills, and fixed-income mutual funds. The concept of fixed rates is a relatively new and unexplored field in DeFi where variable interest rates offered by protocols like Aave and Compound are the norm.\n\nAs of today, the fixed income landscape can be broadly defined in three different categories:\nSecuritization and Tranching\nFixed-Rate Lending and Borrowing\nInterest Rate Swaps\nSecuritization and Tranching protocols were the first ones to hit the market. At a high level, applications such as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/saffron\"\u003eSaffron Finance\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/barnbridge\"\u003eBarnBridge\u003c/a\u003e aggregate variable yields from distinct lending protocols to create separate risk tranches each one with a different risk/return profile allowing users to customize their exposure to yields. Before risk-tranching protocols were around, users faced an all-or-nothing scenario. They either incurred 100% of the risk of lending/providing liquidity or none by staying out of the game. With risk-tranching protocols, DeFi users now have a spectrum of risk options available instead of a simple binary option.\n\nThe second wave of fixed income protocols that entered the space were fixed rate lending and borrowing applications. Unlike Aave and Compound, which primarily offer variable interest rates, protocols like Yield and Notional enable users to borrow and lend at fixed rates over a predetermined time horizon. These protocols don’t expose users to interest rate volatility making it easy to plan ahead and properly hedge risk when lending and borrowing.\n\nThe third and most recent kind of fixed income applications in DeFi are interest rate swap protocols. At their core, these protocols take interest-bearing tokens (like aTokens and cTokens) and separate them into a principal component and a yield component. Given the variable nature of interest-bearing tokens, the value of the yield component fluctuates over time while the value of the principal component stays the same. The result is the creation of interest rate markets that allow users to speculate on the future state of yields. Protocols such as Pendle, Element, and Swivel are at the forefront of the interest-rate derivatives space.\n\nStablecoins\nThe stablecoins story continues to rhyme each subsequent quarter – climbing up and to the right. Q2 was no different. In Q2 2021 the stablecoin monetary base reached over $107 billion, up 70% since Q1 and 803% year-over-year.\n\nStablecoins continue to be adopted for a number of reasons:\nThey’re easy to accept as payments given that all you need is an address on a public blockchain\nThey run on global public infrastructure that operates 24/7/365 which makes them incredibly available and reliable\nThey offer users stronger autonomy, privacy, and interoperability qualities than existing payments solutions which require KYC and often restrict access\nThey’re programmable which allows for developers to trivially build with them and deploy applications with global distribution and instant access to capital\nIn this quarter stablecoins facilitated an impressive $1.7 trillion in transaction volume, up 1,090% year-over-year and 59% since Q1.\n\nThe biggest winners this quarter were USDC, BUSD, and DAI which grew their share to 23%, 9%, and 5%, respectively. Although USDT is still king, its dominance is gradually fading as time passes.\n\nFinally, zooming into the subsector of decentralized stablecoins, we see continued progress as decentralized stablecoins continue to win share from centralized stablecoins. In the beginning of Q2 decentralized stablecoins reached an all-time high ~10% of the total stablecoin supply.\n\nThough DAI’s market share sank in Q1 in large part due to the rise of Terra’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terrausd\"\u003eUST\u003c/a\u003e, it remains the market leader by a wide margin with a 61% share of the market. In Q2 it recovered some share as it continued to grow while Terra stalled out.\n\nQ2 Developments\nUSDC Rises and Becomes DeFi’s Preferred Stablecoin\nPerhaps no stablecoin had a better quarter than Circle’s USDC. Not only does Circle continue to execute on an impressive turnaround recently announcing a $440 million raise as well as plans to go public in a $4.5 billion SPAC deal, but it also continues to make strides in Ethereum’s booming DeFi ecosystem. It will soon overtake \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tether\"\u003eUSDT\u003c/a\u003e as the dominant stablecoin on Ethereum.\n\nOver 50% of the USDC supply now sits in smart contracts - equivalent to ~$12.5 billion. Although this percentage is not as high as DAI, USDC leads by a wide margin in dollar terms.\n\nDAI Continues Incredible Growth While Centralization Risk Increases\nMakerDAO had another incredible quarter growing the DAI supply 76% and earnings 136% over the quarter. The DAI supply reached an impressive $5 billion by quarter ending, while MakerDAO produced $43 million in earnings in the quarter.\n\nHowever, the flip side of this growth was the increased reliance on USDC via its Peg Stability Module (PSM) which played a significant role in allowing DAI to scale better. The PSM operates similarly to a regular vault type with a zero stability fee and a liquidation ratio of 100% and allows users to swap USDC for DAI with zero slippage and with a small spread. This has allowed DAI to be better arbitraged around its peg, but also meant that as the DAI supply grew the collateral backing it increasingly consisted of USDC. Currently 55% of the DAI supply was generated by USDC via the PSM. This is important because while the majority of DAI is still backed by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eETH\u003c/a\u003e, vaults only have liabilities against the DAI they created, meaning that not all the ETH that is backing DAI in aggregate necessarily backs each DAI liability.\n\nSource: DaiStats\n\nTerra Growth Stalls After May Crash\nIn Q1 Terra’s UST stablecoin quickly became the second largest decentralized stablecoin in the industry after building a bridge to Ethereum and launching liquidity mining for its new synthetic asset protocol, Mirror. It now has an exciting DeFi ecosystem of its own providing many ways to earn yield on its stablecoins. However, in the months following the May crash, growth has stalled out with the UST supply down slightly. The most likely culprit for this pause in growth is the decreased liquidity mining incentives for all the protocols UST was being used in due to deflated token prices.\n\nTerra also faced its first big test during the May crash as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra\"\u003eLUNA\u003c/a\u003e, the seigniorage token backing it, plummeted 75% over the course of five days, putting serious pressure on the UST peg. However, since then UST has stabilized and confidence in the peg has been restored.\n\nLooking Forward\nThe Rise of Non Pegged Stablecoins\nWhen Bitcoin was born it captured people’s imagination on the potential for non-sovereign digital currencies. But as Bitcoin began trading it soon became clear that it would not be stable enough to be used as currency anytime soon. The promise was that sometime in the distant future it would eventually stabilize once it became a large enough asset and built up enough liquidity. However, even that is uncertain considering Bitcoin is a fixed supply asset and unable to adjust its supply relative to demand, which may deem it to forever be volatile just like Gold is.\n\nTo bridge the gap between now and this promised future the industry created dollar pegged stablecoins which solved the volatility bug and catalyzed adoption for many blockchain applications beyond holding. However, the problem these dollar pegged stablecoins cause is that they dollarized Ethereum. With the dollar ultimately being controlled by the Federal Reserve, this limits Ethereum’s monetary system from becoming sovereign. It also subjects Ethereum to regulatory risk that borders systemic due its reliance on gray market dollar pegged stablecoins (though this risk is decreasing with USDC gaining market share vs USDT).\n\nFortunately the industry has taken notice and a new wave of projects have recently launched aiming to create stablecoins that are not pegged to fiat currencies at all. Called “non pegged stablecoins,” these projects offer a radical opportunity for Ethereum’s monetary system to achieve stability while eliminating dependence on fiat currencies. In the process they would not only free Ethereum’s monetary system from the influence of the nation state controlled central banks, but also introduce truly trust-minimized stablecoins fit for use across Ethereum’s economy.\nFor now non pegged stablecoins may seem like a far-out experiment without a clear use case, but they may also be the best bet this industry has on creating non-sovereign stable cryptocurrencies.\nAsset Management\n\nUnsurprisingly as liquidity in DeFi protocols soared over the quarter, yield aggregators, which funnel liquidity into DeFi, saw their total value locked soar as well. Similarly when the market turned many saw their TVL fall in lockstep (with some exceptions like Yearn). After a strong Q1 that saw assets under management rise 272%, assets under management ended Q2 down 2% after having peaked at $9.5 billion mid-quarter.\n\nAs for the yield aggregator market, the story of the quarter was the comeback and rise of Yearn which saw its market share rocket from 29% to 69% in the quarter (more on this below).\n\nQ2 Developments\nYearn’s Growing Dominance\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the biggest story in the asset management sector for Q2 was Yearn’s resurgence and growing dominance. With Yearn’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/on-inflation-treasuries-incentive-alignment-and-fair-launches-in-defi\"\u003eincentive alignment issue\u003c/a\u003e having been addressed in Q1 clearing concerns over Yearn’s funding, focus then shifted to Yearn’s new V2 vaults. Yearn V2 has become a resounding success, leading Yearn’s assets under management from just $540 million at the beginning of the year to $4.1 billion by the end of Q2. Perhaps the most impressive feat Yearn achieved this quarter, however, was it continuing to grow AUM throughout the May crash, even reaching a new all-time high of over $5 billion by the end of May. It now controls just under 70% of the yield aggregator market.\n\nLike MakerDAO (mentioned above) which also had an incredible quarter, Yearn grew its revenue in lockstep with AUM as well, producing $18.5 million in revenue for Q2, up 236% from Q1.\n\nBetween new protocols building on top of Yearn such as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/alchemix-bringing-future-yields-to-the-present\"\u003eAlchemix\u003c/a\u003e which created a MakerDAO like credit system using Yearn’s vaults as infrastructure, revenue sharing agreements with protocols that drive assets to Yearn vaults such as Badger, and a handful of new vaults for volatile assets such as Synthetix, it's becoming increasingly apparent that Yearn is an essential yield primitive for the DeFi ecosystem. The\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-theory-of-the-yearn\"\u003e Theory of Yearn\u003c/a\u003e continues to hold water.\n\nExpanding the Reach of On-Chain Asset Management  - Enzyme V2\nAt the beginning of the year, on-chain asset management protocol Melon went through a rebranding process to a more DeFi-flavored theme called Enzyme Finance. In addition to changing the logo and name to create a more vibrant image, the protocol greatly expanded the investable asset universe available to portfolio managers. The protocol now supports nearly 150+ different assets, a significant amount considering the previous version had less than twenty assets to choose from. Additionally, asset managers now have the ability to engage in more sophisticated investment activities including lending, liquidity provisioning, and shorting through synthetic assets.\n\nRecently, Enzyme has been scaling up its business through a number of DeFi partnerships. Last week, the protocol announced a collaboration with Yearn Finance to enhance its product suite. Through the partnership, Yearn vaults will be directly available on Enzyme allowing asset managers to include advanced yield farming strategies as part of their overall portfolio. Another recent collaboration took place last month between Enzyme and Unslashed Finance. In this joint effort, Unslashed Finance invested 4,000 Ether into a yield strategy on Enzyme in order to “buffer up their capital base for insurance”. As a result, Enzyme’s TVL more than doubled in June going from $16 million to $50 billion, according to DeFi Llama.\n\n \nLooking Forward\nA New Paradigm in Liquidity Provision\nAs a consequence of Uniswap V3’s concentrated liquidity model, liquidity management is no longer a passive game. The famous “set and forget” strategy that once dominated liquidity provisioning has become antiquated and suboptimal. In this new world, the highest returns will flow to those who research, develop and successfully implement active management strategies by constantly updating liquidity ranges to capture the highest amount of trading fees.\n\nUniswap’s new functionality has led to the creation of a new breed of market participants called “Liquidity Managers”. In the same way, professional asset managers are paid to effectively navigate the uncertain waters of financial markets, Liquidity Managers seek to fill the same need in the increasingly complicated realm of liquidity management. There are early entrants to the arena such as Visor, Lixir, Charm, Popsicle, and Gelato Network, as well as the elephant in the room Yearn which is also developing Uniswap V3 strategies.\nDerivatives\n\nDerivatives Landscape\nDecentralized derivative volumes continued their massive growth in the second quarter of 2021. Although still a fraction of decentralized spot trading volumes (see DEX section), perpetual swap trading volumes reached nearly $20 billion in the quarter, more than a 3,000% increase from Q4 2020 and a 155% jump from the previous quarter. Despite the current scaling hurdles (more on this below), decentralized derivative protocols are starting to see strong signs of adoption among DeFi users.\n\nFollowing the market crash, trading volumes in June unsurprisingly declined as investors’ appetite for risky assets and leverage vanished in the face of increasing market uncertainty. However, when compared to levels at the beginning of 2021, trading volumes remain on a steady upward trend.\n\nQ2 Developments\nDominating the Decentralized Perpetual Swap Market - Perpetual Protocol\nThe most important development in the second quarter of 2021 was the dominant rise of Perpetual Protocol. Despite its late arrival relative to incumbent players like dYdX, Perpetual Protocols currently offers investors the most trading options available in the perpetual swaps market and controls the vast majority of the decentralized futures trading volume.\n\nIn a matter of six months, Perpetual Protocol became the dominant perpetual swaps exchange by a wide margin. At the beginning of 2021, the protocol controlled less than 30% of all the trading volume in decentralized futures markets. After five months, its dominance tripled, now controlling over 90% of the perpetual swap market.\n\nLooking Forward\nIn Honor of Marie Curie -  Perpetual Protocol V2\nPerpetual Protocol announced the release of the second version of the protocol called “Curie'', in honor of the famous physicist Marie Curie. The upgrade is set to launch on Arbitrum in order to improve user experience, increasing transaction speeds, and lower trading costs. Additionally, the upgrade will launch with cross-margin collateral management allowing traders to use the same pool of collateral to open multiple positions.\n\nOne of the most important features of V2 is the combination of Perpetual Protocol’s vAMM with Uniswap V3 as the protocol’s trading settlement layer. The merger will allow Perpetual Protocol to leverage Uniswap’s concentrated liquidity feature, improving the capital efficiency of the entire protocol. Moving forward, all trades will be executed on Uniswap, using v-tokens, while keeping the trader experience the same as before.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of using Uniswap as the trading layer for the system is the emergence of a whole new way of liquidity provisioning. In addition to earning protocol fees, liquidity providers (called makers) will be able to apply leverage when providing liquidity to the protocol. In the same way that traders use the protocol to lever their long/short positions, makers will be able to deposit USDC on Perpetual Protocol and have the option to instruct the clearinghouse - the smart contract in charge of minting v-tokens - to mint vUSDC with up to 10x leverage. The vUSDC can then be deployed in a Uniswap V3 pool essentially creating a leverage liquidity position.\n\nSource: Perpetual Protocol\n\nIn addition to the trading mechanism enchantments, Curie will also allow permissionless market creation. The protocol will support Uniswap V3 TWAP and Chainlink oracles to determine the index price of any asset including non-crypto assets like stock and commodities.\nRollups To the Rescue\nAs mentioned earlier, decentralized derivative protocols currently face a number of hurdles that have hampered the growth of the space. Today, there are three main reasons why the decentralized futures market hasn't reached widespread adoption. The first relates to token compossibility. At the moment, derivative products can’t be used in activities like liquidity provisioning, yield farming, staking, or governance making them inferior to physical tokens in terms of utility. The second reason is market depth. Due to the nascency of the sector, most exchanges have limited liquidity to trade against and also lack hefty insurance funds to backstop unexpected losses arising from leverage trading.\n\nLastly, the third reason, and likely the most important one, is Ethereuem’s high fee environment. By nature, derivative products are much more sophisticated financial instruments compared to physical tokens. Therefore, trading derivative instruments in a decentralized manner tends to be more complex than spot trading.\n\nAs a consequence, derivatives trading volume, in particular perpetual swaps, is hindered by higher transaction costs which are either incurred by the derivatives exchange or passed on to the trader. However, derivatives applications are on the cusp of reaching a wider market as protocols take advantage of the scaling capabilities offered by Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nAs the Layer-2 race heats up, derivative protocols are starting to pick their respective horses. For the most part, perpetual swap exchanges like MCDEX, Futureswap, and Perpetual Protocol are choosing Arbitrum as their scaling solution (MCDEX went live on mainnet last month and the remaining two will launch in testnet in the coming months). In late 2020, dYdX announced a partnership with StarkWare, and after eight months of work, the team successfully ported its perpetual trading platform to StarkEx, StarkWare’s Layer-2 scalability engine. Lastly, earlier this year Synthetix staking contract went live on Optimism Ethereum, making the first Ethereum-native DeFi application to cross the chasm to the Layer-2 world.\n\nThe Seeds of DeFi’s Next Leg\nWhile it's clear in many cases that DeFi activity has been negatively impacted by declining market sentiment and depressed asset prices, the sector remains multiples larger than it was even just to start the year. In the coming months in quarters ahead it is likely DeFi has its growing up moment as scaling solutions arrive, institutions begin to dip their toes into DeFi protocols, and ecosystems continue to mature, providing increased safety for users.\n\nIt's not yet clear when market sentiment will turn around for the sector. It not only took one of the biggest hits post May crash, but also underperformed ETH as a whole year-to-date. In any case DeFi will continue to march on, with each step making progress towards a radically new open, global financial system governed by code but built for people.\n\nLearn more from Mainnet 2021\nWatch main stage programming from Messari's annual summit Mainnet 2021 to learn more about this exciting topic.

      "title": "Web3 \u0026 NFT Q2'21 Report",
      "content": "If someone walked up to me and said at the beginning of the year, NFTs will easily surpass $1 billion in sales, GaryVee will launch an NFT project, and Axie Infinity becomes one of the top five NFT marketplaces, I would have replied, “I’ll believe one of three”. But, the past quarter (Q2’21’) witnessed over $750 million across the top five collectibles, Axie’s Marketplace generated $7.7 million in fees, and GaryVee has already earned over one million in royalties from his NFT project. Let’s break it down.\nNFT Bubbles It’s Bubble\nThe media narrative that the NFT market is dead or that the bubble has popped is objectively mistaken. The media largely focused on crypto art and collectibles (e.g. NBA Top Shot), but the broad NFT ecosystem continues to grow. In fact, OpenSea recorded its best month ever in June in terms of NFT sales volume. Rarible’s poor performance (relative to OpenSea) can largely be attributed to the marketplace not providing access to some NFT categories that boomed over the past few months including NFT avatars, Art Blocks, sports collectibles, and virtual worlds.\n\nOpenSea is telling a canary in the coalmine for NFT growth. In June, OpenSea facilitated over 211,000 NFT sales across nearly 40,000 active traders.\n\nOverall, June marked OpenSea’s best month ever for NFT volume, a record number of NFT sales, and its second-best month of active traders.\n\nWhile OpenSea remains the overall marketplace leader, Axie Infinity surged throughout the quarter becoming the four largest NFT marketplace. Notably, Atomic Market – the go-to marketplace for NFTs on WAX – now ranks 8th in NFT marketplaces.\n\nAxie Infinity’s growth followed the Phase 2 migration of Ronin, its Ethereum-linked sidechain which provides reduced gas fees and a more seamless user experience. While Axie’s can be exchanged on other platforms, 97% of Axie volume occurs on the Axie Marketplace which passes fees (in \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/axie-infinity\"\u003eAXS\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eETH\u003c/a\u003e) to the Axie Treasury.\n\nThe Axie Treasury is now valued at over $21 million, with 85% of it having been ($18 million) accrued in the past quarter through breeding and marketplace fees. Axie Infinity has set itself apart from the rest of the pack – crypto games – and continues to rise. The next major milestone will be the launch of AXS staking in Q3, and the alpha of its virtual world, Lunacia in Q4.\n\nAvatars: Not The Last NFTs\nPerhaps one of the most significant trends throughout the past quarter was the continuation of NFT avatar projects. NFT Avatars – collectibles specifically designed for individuals to represent themselves across the internet (e.g. CryptoPunks) – continued to grow in popularity as the emerging sector generated nearly $350 million in secondary sales throughout Q2’21 and nearly $600 million in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe Magic Number: 10,000ish\nJust as DeFi’s summer witnessed a food-based fork of every successful DeFi protocol, NFT blue-chip projects like CryptoPunks are undergoing a similar fork-apalooza.\n\nMost of these new projects launched with CryptoPunk-esque traits include a limited number of around 10,000 NFTs, unique attributes across each NFT with different rarity levels, and a community focused on advocacy regarding the future value of its avatar project.\nSome of the launches include:\nMeebits – 20,000 unique 3D characters by Larva Labs (creators of CryptoPunks) designed to be avatars for virtual worlds. Existing CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs owners were also able to claim a free Meebit.\nBored Ape Yacht Club – Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTs with access to the “Swap Club”, a Bored Ape members only group.\nBored Ape Kennel Club – Man’s Ape’s best friend. Similar to Meebits, every BAYC was offered a free dog for “adoption”, because every ape needs a dog, I guess.\nWicked Craniums – A collection of 10,762 NFTs where each Cranium is your ticket to “The Cradle”, a Cranium members-only group.\nBulls on The Block – early community members of BAYC that wanted to create a wallet for secondary sales to accrue for the community. There are 10,000 unique bulls similar to BAYC.\nMy Fking Pickle – 10,000 self fking explanatory pickles\nSlumdog Billionaires – because every facet of crypto needs 10,000 more doge dogs.\nThe Larva Labs team was quite intentional with their Meebits project. Since Meebits were claimable by Punks or Glyph holders, Meebits provided added value to the existing Larva Labs community. This creates the perception of Meebits as connected to CryptoPunks – and the punk value narrative – as opposed to the perception of devaluing their existing collectible from a newer, unrelated NFT. Moreover, Bored Apes have notably generated over $60 million in sales in Q2’21 and currently rank 3rd on the NFT avatars list by volume (behind Punks and Meebits).\n\nHowever, most of these NFT avatar projects might be relegated to the same fate of Hashmasks, a once-prominent NFT project that has since lulled since its February launch, only generating $2 million in secondary sales over the past quarter.\n\nA larger point with NFT avatars is that most of these communities are relatively small and owned by a small number of individuals. Meebits have the largest owner base, although they do have twice as many NFTs (20,000 vs ~10,000) compared to most of the other NFT avatar projects. Still, there is a strong concentration in all of these projects, with wealthier individuals like Gary Vaynerchuk who revealed that he owns 52 Punks and 54 Meebits.\n\nUltimately the concentrated ownership helps drive the scarcity narrative, but reduces the growth of the community unless individuals sell. Similar to the luxury goods industry, there’s a limited number of buyers. Additionally, as other types of intellectual property launch NFT avatars (think Batman NFTs) then the demand for crypto native avatars may decrease. Genies – avatar NFTs on Flow – recently raised a $65 million Series B in May and has established partnerships with various celebrities including Rihanna, Shawn Mendes, and Cardi B. It’s likely that these types of NFTs will draw significant attention as the respective stars sell their NFTs to their loyal fans.\n\nAvatar NFTs are an emerging sector that will ultimately face power law distributions, some will be worthwhile while most will be worth much less. Among crypto native avatar projects, CryptoPunks are established and will likely remain the standard for NFT blue-chips within crypto while other crypto-native avatar projects find themselves struggling to grow adoption due to an influx of celebrity and IP style avatar projects.\n\nWeb3 Adoption Hits Tipping Point\nThe \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-origins-of-web3-and-why-it-matters-more-than-ever\"\u003eproliferation of Web3 has been long awaited\u003c/a\u003e, but failed to manifest fully because of a need for infrastructure across computation, indexing, data management, hosting, storage, and other vital services. However, after many years of building and continued growth, many Web3 protocols are starting to hit their stride.\n\nMiddleware layers that have been continuously building for years are now experiencing the on-set of product-market fit. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/livepeering-into-the-future-of-video\"\u003eLivepeer\u003c/a\u003e a marketplace for video infrastructure providers and streaming applications is processing millions of videos per week and generating several thousands in protocol fee revenue.\n\nThe Graph officially migrated to its mainnet where it has deployed subgraphs of several protocols and is now generating several thousand dollars per week in fees.\n\nSource: Web3Index\n\nOcean Protocol’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/towards-a-new-data-marketplace-ocean-protocol-v3-release\"\u003edata marketplace\u003c/a\u003e – which lets individuals issue data sets as balancer liquidity pools – possesses a TVL of over $3.3 million across 419 data set pools.\n\nFile and data storage networks also continue to gain adoption:\nData stored on Arweave grew another 1.8 terabytes (1,800 gigabytes)\nStorage capacity utilized on Sia has reached an all-time high of 1.09 PB (1 petabyte = 1,000 terabytes) with a capacity of 3.25 PB.\nThe total data stored on Filecoin now exceeds 23 petabytes.\nElsewhere, Web3 protocols like Handshake are experiencing increased usage with nearly 1.5 million registered Namebase domains and over 100,000 Handshake domains in use today. Helium’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-people-s-network-the-future-of-mobile-wireless\"\u003enetwork \u003c/a\u003eadds thousands of nodes per week, resulting in 147 billion data credits spent (equivalent to ~3,500 GBs) for total net revenue of just over $1.4 million (mostly used to add new hotspots).\n\nStill, while many individual components of Web3 are poised for their breakout moments, the full stack has yet to find a way to interoperate with DeFi, NFTs, or other Web3 protocols. Web3 is no longer a star in the distant future. The stack is coming together and the stars are quickly aligning.\n\nCelebrity, Influencer, and Brand NFTs\nDread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same.\n\nAs celebrities like GaryVee dive deeper into the water of crypto, the risk of entry for other celebrities and influencers decreases.\n\nGary Vaynerchuk – more commonly referred to as GaryVee – is now entering the crypto industry with his new NFT project – VeeFriends. Since its early May launch, the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/veefriends-a-ticket-to-the-vee-land?referrer=list-view\"\u003edual NFT project and brand monetization experiment\u003c/a\u003e has been quite successful generating over $11 million in secondary sales in the quarter.\n\nMoreover, renowned artists like Jay-Z are entering crypto, using a CryptoPunk as his Twitter avatar image. More importantly, the Rap Mogul conducted a Sotheby’s auction of “Heir to the Throne”, an NFT collection based on his debut album which ultimately fetched $139,000.\n\nMusicians which have historically had trouble monetizing their work (except through concerts) have become first movers in NFT experimentation. Yellow Heart – an NFT ticketing marketplace – has already developed and issued NFT collections with Maroon 5 and The Kings of Leon which come with additional perks like front row seats, access to a listening party, portraits that accompany the albums, and more.\n\nAnd if individuals are capitalizing on brand monetization via NFTs, large established brands aren’t going to lag for long. Twitter recently launched the “Twitter 140 collection” on Rarible, a set of NFTs that encompass Twitter’s history and pop culture.\nClosing Out Q2\nSometimes a quarter passes by mostly unnoticed. Other times, a quarter experiences breakout trends. For Web3 the quarter fell somewhere in the middle. The Web3 sector experienced some jolts growth and reached some milestones, but overall trended steadily upwards.\n\nAmong NFTs the quarter was quieter from a mass consumer perspective, but not from an analytical reference. Art sales declined, but NFT speculators moved to greener pastures (as all speculators do). Still, the NFT landscape continues to expand, branching out into various new fields that have yet to be explored, albeit even if that means we have to let celebrities through the OpenSea gates. What next quarter holds is anyone’s guess, but if these trends continue the second half of the year is setting up to be spectacular for those who care about Web3 and NFT adoption.\n",

      "title": "2Q'21 Currency Sector Recap",
      "content": "The 2Q’21 was a tale of two halves in one of the most eventful quarters of the Currency sector’s history.\n\nThe first half of the quarter was full of jubilations as Coinbase (COIN) employees popped champagne during the company's direct listing on April 14, 2021. Bitcoin reached all time highs (ATHs) of over $60,000, and there were more eyes on crypto than ever before. Institutional investors and banks moved to announce their involvement in the digital assets sphere, pouring equity capital and launching new initiatives to get their clients onboard. Even State Street, the second oldest bank in the US with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, announced it will be building a crypto trading platform.\n\nWe also saw speculative mania of DOGE reaching \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin\"\u003e$0.74\u003c/a\u003e on the back of Elon posing as the Dogefather on Saturday Night Live (SNL). ASS, SHIBA and CUMMIES also saw the limelight, though meme coins rarely warrant mainstream media attention. Mark Zuckerberg even announced the names of his two goats, Max and Bitcoin, perhaps hinting to the world that he’s a Bitcoin maximalist.\n\nBitcoin 2Q’21\nWhile Bitcoin’s price rallied +10% in the first part of April, its price ended the month down by -9%. The sudden drop in value should’ve raised a few red flags but markets ignored warning signs of a major reversal or market fatigue since Bitcoin had seen six consecutive positive months, a first since 2012. In retrospect, there were indeed signs of market fatigue. The COIN direct listing saw the price collapse by -20% in the first days of trading, and Tesla also announced it had sold 10% of their Bitcoin position for treasury management reasons. Nevertheless, all indications still pointed to a bull run as the remainder of the crypto market diverged from Bitcoin’s price performance. In April, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eETH\u003c/a\u003e was up +44%, DOGE continued its winning streak up +463%, and even late-cycle \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\"\u003eETC\u003c/a\u003e was up 146%.\n\nIn mid-May, Bitcoin’s price began to reverse seeing the largest reversal as its third-worst performing month in history, down -38%. This finally ended narratives that this rally was just like the 2017 bull market.\n\nIt wasn’t even like the 2013 bull market either, as investors found themselves in uncharted waters. Never before had a four-year cyclical top been so tame and never before had a mid-bull run reversal been so severe.\n\nThe month of May also brought an onslaught of sequential negative news events in a FUD  (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) bath. Market participants began to wonder if this attack on Bitcoin was coordinated. Negative news included Tesla ceasing to accept Bitcoin for purchases, citing Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) concerns. This resulted in mainstream media frequently reporting on Bitcoin’s coal usage and impact on global warming. Even the Pope commented on the detriments of technology based on “highly polluting fossil fuels”. Most importantly, Tesla’s announcement sparked Elon Musk’s damaging verbal diarrhea on Bitcoin, even after agreeing that Bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy.\n\n  Source: Travis Kling\n\nMany valid ESG rebuttals (here, here, here, and here) were provided but were largely ignored by mainstream media. Michael Saylor even championed a North American Bitcoin Mining Council to collect renewable usage data. As soon as it seemed that Bitcoin was heading in the right direction with ESG, the public outcry ceased by mid-June, as quickly as it started. The Bitcoin ESG FUD would be shelved for another day. For Q2’21, the Bitcoin Mining Council reported that the Bitcoin Mining energy usage only amounted to 0.12% of the World’s total energy consumption.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Mining Council\n\nIn the US, the sector also saw one of the busiest months of regulatory headwinds. The US Senate Banking Committee urged the new Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Head to review past favorable crypto rulings and the OCC, FDIC and the Fed was reportedly in talks about an interagency crypto policy team. The FDIC, in its capacity as a federal banking regulator, was issuing requests for information from banks on crypto usage. The IRS was reportedly cracking down on crypto tax evasion. The IRS was also, along with the US Justice Department, investigating the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Additionally, New York State introduced a Senate Bill to halt Bitcoin mining for three years while it assessed the environmental impact. The Treasury called for crypto transfers above $10,000 to be reported to the IRS. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called the US crypto regulatory framework inadequate and pushed for a new framework and SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated greater investor protection is needed on crypto exchanges. Most damaging of all could have been the slew of fake news and unsubstantiated claims.\n\nSeparately, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin could have meant that \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/macro-update-on-bubbles-taper-tantrums\"\u003emacroeconomics played a role\u003c/a\u003e in this selldown. On May 12 2021, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) printed +4.2%,the highest inflation print since September 2008. In light of signs of overheating in the market, though mitigated by bad jobs numbers, the Fed’s meeting minutes hinted that they were beginning to think about, thinking about tapering. This led to a knee jerk reaction of US real yields rising +9bps though traditional financial markets remained relatively calm. Markets already knew that inflation numbers were high due to a low base effect from COVID-19. However, Bitcoin, at the extreme end of the risk curve for traditional institutional investors, saw a major selldown. The month after, the CPI print of 5% was even higher but it didn’t warrant a market reaction. As expected, the Fed will patiently wait for economic data to decide if they will bring forth tapering from the expected Q1’22E. Concerns of tapering subsided, but Bitcoin’s price failed to recover.\n\nIn China, the Vice Premier Liu announced a crackdown specifically on crypto mining and trading. It was nothing new -- China had banned securities companies from engaging in Bitcoin since 2013, and also banned trading in 2017. However, never before had the announcement come from someone so senior in the China Communist Party, the chair of the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee. And never before had Bitcoin mining and trading been specifically stated. The government newspaper, Xinhua, also published articles citing a series of crypto-related scams, with 1,100 people arrested for money laundering through crypto. Reasons cited by the public focus on social stability, especially important before the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary on July 1.\n\nThis resulted in Chinese search engine Baidu removing Binance, Huobi and OKEx. Weibo, a prominent social media platform, blocked major exchanges and key opinion leaders. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBTC \u003c/a\u003emarket data was also removed from security trading platforms like Tencent-backed Futu and Tiger Securities. Additionally, companies highlighted that their plans to launch crypto trading services would target non-China domiciled clients. Major crypto exchanges Huobi and OKEx scaled back on leveraged trading, from a maximum of 125x to less than 5x. Furthermore, new clients wouldn’t have access to the leverage trading function.\n\nSource: WuBlockchain\n\nOn the mining front, the Inner Mongolia region was the first to comply, followed by more important regions such as Xinjian, the most important mining region during the dry season. As miners packed up, the total hash rate, an indicator of the computing power in the network, halved from mid May to the end of the quarter. While Bitcoin’s hash rate has not recovered yet from the largest sustained percentage decline, perhaps the worst is already behind us in terms of the impact of China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining. We expect hash rate to recover over the course of the year, as miners find other venues of electricity and restart their operations. Many of the miners from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan are reportedly moving to various locations including Kazakhstan, Texas and Norway.\n\nJust as suddenly as the noise around environmental concerns rapidly died off towards the end of June -- so did concerns of China’s mining shutdown. Overall, these are net long-term positives for Bitcoin as what doesn’t kill it only makes it stronger. Indeed, as the world becomes more environmentally friendly and no institutional investors want to run afoul of the ESG movement, Bitcoin will need to pivot towards renewable energy to gain global adoption. Also, false narratives that Bitcoin is a “Chinese financial weapon” or that Bitcoin is a threat to US national security -- the code is literally open sourced -- can finally be put to bed as mining hashpower will more evenly be distributed throughout the world.\n\nTowards the end of the quarter, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in an effort to de-dollarize and reduce the cost of remittances. The government also announced a $30 airdrop for all adults through its own digital wallet. While Bitcoin’s global penetration is ~2%, El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce’s data indicates that 21-25% of the population would use BTC. While there was no meaningful impact on Bitcoin’s price, it was a global step towards wider adoption. Furthermore, it could be the first of several countries to adopt Bitcoin as Paraguay also announced a bill that would make Bitcoin legal tender.\n\nSource: Steve Hanke\nBitcoin Markets\nIn terms of markets, derivatives were punished this quarter. Markets started strong, with ETH touching $3,000 on May 3 only to have $246 million of open interest in the ETH call $5,000 strike the day after. However, by the end of the quarter, given the waterfall of liquidations, Bitcoin Futures open interest reset to levels seen at the start of the year.\n\nFrom the peak of April 14, open interest declined -56%. The first large liquidation happened April 18, with $9.3 billion of longs liquidated (mostly from Binance) but the market recovered after. Despite the April wipe out, on May 19, liquidiations reached $7.6 billion (mostly from Huobi, Bybit and OKEx), crashing the market further as leveraged hands were forced to sell.\n\nDespite the aggressive liquidations, and subsequent spot selling, large holders (100 to 1,000 BTC) actually accumulated during the selldown:\n\nSource: Woonomic, Glassnode\n\nIt also seemed as if traders in the US time zone were more bearish than those in Asia, a reversal of the 90-day period prior to mid-May.\n\nCurrency Sector: 2Q’21 Outperformers\nDogecoin (+325%), Ethereum Classic (+268%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/xrp\"\u003eXRP\u003c/a\u003e (+12%) and Ethereum (+3%) had a positive quarter.\n\nDOGE benefited from its primary champion, Elon Musk, with no less than 13 tweets mentioning “Doge”. To his 57 million followers, Musk also tweeted that he’s “working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency” which baffled most crypto investors who noticed there had been no development for the past several years. However, the social media prowess of DOGE is strong and the price rallied to an ATH of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin\"\u003e$0.74 on May 8\u003c/a\u003e, the time that SNL’s Dogefather aired. From the beginning of the month, DOGE’s price had multiplied by 12x at that time, before ending the quarter at ‘just’ 5x. Separately, Coinbase also listed DOGE on June 3 (in addition to an Ethereum-based dog coin SHIBA on June 15).\n\nHowever, even before the SNL run-up, DOGE rallied 500% over a week in mid-April, nearly flipping Binance Coin (BNB). Ahead of the Coinbase listing, Reddit’s wallstreetbets moderator reversed their ban on crypto -- allowing the discussion of BTC, ETH and DOGE. In less than 24 hours, they regretted the decision and reiterated its crypto ban on the subreddit. The DOGE pump that ensued was a demonstration of the power-of-the-people. While the price dropped -66% from its ATHs by quarter-end, DOGE’s outperformance over the quarter showed its meme sway remained strong.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) also saw a strong run up in the quarter. (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic/profile\"\u003eETC\u003c/a\u003e) is the legacy chain that split from Ethereum following a contentious hard fork, known as The DAO fork, in Jul. 2017. On May 7ths, ETC saw a $55 billion 24h volume while its market cap was just $17 billion. Messari’s clean volume of vetted exchanges just showed \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic/historical\"\u003e$414 million\u003c/a\u003e in volumes, indicating that there could have been a lot of fake volumes on ETC. Nevertheless, ETC had several status updates this quarter, publishing a roadmap and 2021 budget and introducing new software releases and network upgrades.\n\nXRP continued to outperform (+12%), following its Q1’21 +164% rally. This was on the back of easing concerns after a -30% selldown following the SEC's enforcement action in Dec-2020. Their General Counsel maintains that regulatory uncertainty is deliberately maintained by the SEC and that XRP is unjustly singled out as a security, while BTC and ETH roam free.\n\nLast but not least, ETH ended the quarter up +13%. Ethereum had a strong first half of the first quarter, with talks of a supercycle and flippening. Deribit, an options platform, saw $5,000 calls with a notional value of $331 million by May 11. Crypto loves a good narrative and Ethereum had many. Layer 2 scaling solutions were just kicking off, with Polygon taking the lead.  Ethereum implemented the Berlin upgrade on April 15 and the upcoming EIP-1559 was also going to solve some of the pain of the high transaction fees. Furthermore, ETH’s supply was about to become deflationary in supply. ETH was also unscathed from ESG critics of Bitcoin mining as it was moving towards ETH 2.0 with a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Furthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) was reaching new highs for on-chain activity.\n\nHowever, in a Bitcoin selldown, gravity takes over and every token is correlated and this time was no different. ETH has still outperformed Bitcoin overall, after diverging around mid-April but gave back 16% of the performance in June.\n\nEthereum’s market share is still minor but climbing. Though DOGE, ETC and XRP’s market share in the currencies sector is still small. Bitcoin dominance in the Currencies sector fell from 79% to 65% this quarter:\n\nCurrency Sector: 2Q’21 Underperformers\nOther than \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e (-39%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dash\"\u003eDash\u003c/a\u003e (-44%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/stellar\"\u003eStellar\u003c/a\u003e (-31%) and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-sv\"\u003eBitcoin SV\u003c/a\u003e (-30%) were key underperformers.\n\nDash was initially released as a fork of Bitcoin, but had a strong marketing narrative as it was focused on the payments use case. They released a couple of software and on-chain upgrades this quarter, that will cumulate to their July 15 hard fork. Their underperformance this quarter could be attributed to its strong run up of +109% in Feb-2021.\n\nStellar (XLM), a fork of the Ripple protocol, made two major network upgrades. While XRP and XLM were correlated last quarter, XLM underperformed this round. It could be a testament to the importance of the size of the community during a selldown.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) is a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork prioritizing what the creators consider strict adherence to Satoshi Nakamo's original Bitcoin client. It continued to underperform after just rallying +28% in 1Q’21. There have been no major announcements or upgrades from BSV this quarter.

If markets don’t recover from here, expectations are of a mild bear market since the rally was rather mild -- a 3.2x from the prior Bitcoin ATH instead of a 20x return. Furthermore, during the 2018 bear market, investors were still bullish and hopeful in the first half of 2018. However, this time around, sentiment instantly flipped bearish -- perhaps an indication that investors were hoping to front run any risk of a bear turn. Many investors have been traumatized by the 2017 and 2013 blow-off tops and subsequent deep and prolonged bear markets, so they could have been quick to pull the sell trigger. What we can conclude is that -- this rally, perhaps due to the wider institutional adoption of Bitcoin, is like no other in the past.\n\nBitcoin, and the crypto sector, had also never before seen an onslaught of attacks from all corners before. The neverending China ‘ban’ and ESG concerns reared its head at the same time, though these narratives have been long-standing sources of FUD for Bitcoin. However, the two largest headwinds for BTC in 2Q’21 were two of the largest tailwinds for ETH -- as Proof-of-Stake makes it harder to geographically locate and censor miners, and no institutional investor wants to seem irreverent to the ESG narrative. While these FUD narratives have been addressed and even falsified, Bitcoin and the crypto community will be stronger in continuing to take measures to evolve the ecosystem.\n\nLearn more from Mainnet 2021\nWatch main stage programming from Messari's annual summit Mainnet 2021 to learn more about this exciting topic.

Following Messari’s sector convention, three out of the five sectors covered in the report ended the week in positive territory while two suffered some minor losses.\n\nThe week was led by the Smart Contract Platform sector which ended with a positive return of 6% driven by assets such as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e (5.12%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/solana\"\u003eSolana\u003c/a\u003e (6.70%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\"\u003eEthereum Classic\u003c/a\u003e (22.85%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/internet-computer\"\u003eInternet Computer\u003c/a\u003e (32.30%). The DeFi sector followed closely in second place finishing the week with a return of 4.8%. Assets such as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/compound\"\u003eCompound\u003c/a\u003e (29.67%),  \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\"\u003eAave\u003c/a\u003e (11.95%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\"\u003eMakerDAO\u003c/a\u003e (13.36%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra\"\u003eTerra\u003c/a\u003e (6.42%) were among the best-performing assets of the sector.\n\nOn the contrary, the Currency sector was the worst-performing one of the week as a sudden appetite for riskier assets hit the markets. The biggest detractor of the sector was \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e which had a 7-day return of -3.74% as investors moved to higher beta tokens in search of higher returns.\n\nSector Portfolio Weights\nThe sector portfolio weights for this week’s report are as follows. The portfolio allocations are constructed following the market capitalization methodology using data as of July 1st.\n\nSector Drill Down\nPerformance during the week ending on July 1st was a bit bumpy but positive overall. Asset prices experienced a small rally during the first day of the week followed by a sharp decline which sent returns to the red zone. However, the story quickly changed as the weekend came to an end.\n\nOn Monday, UK regulators banned Binance from having ongoing operations in the U.K., in the latest sign of the growing crackdown on crypto markets around the world. Despite the bearish news, crypto markets shrugged off the bad press as asset prices rallied, setting a positive tone for the rest of the week.\n\nThe DeFi and Smart Contract Platform portfolios outperformed the rest of the sector portfolios during the week. Within the DeFi portfolio, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/compound\"\u003eCompound\u003c/a\u003e was the top-performing asset finishing the week with a 29.67% return. The portfolio also benefited from the weekly performance of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\"\u003eAave\u003c/a\u003e (11.95%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\"\u003eMakerDAO\u003c/a\u003e (13.36%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/terra\"\u003eTerra\u003c/a\u003e (6.42%). Similarly, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e (5.12%), \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/solana\"\u003eSolana\u003c/a\u003e (6.70%), and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cosmos\"\u003eCosmos\u003c/a\u003e (24%) were the main drivers of performance for the Smart Contract Platform portfolio. Compound outperformed as the protocol announced it will give a fixed 4% APR on US dollars, with daily liquidity, targeted at financial institutions.\n\nDuring the week, Bitcoin’s dominance dipped roughly 4% as investors dialed up risk, rotating away from lower volatility assets into higher-risk assets.\n\nConversely, Ethereum’s dominance spiked 3% during the week in a sign of a rotation to higher volatility tokens.\n\nLast week, volatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, suddenly spiked across the board as markets tumbled down on the back of China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining. However, during this week volatility stabilized and is now ranging from  5% to 7% across all sector portfolios.\n\nSimilarly, the correlation between the sector portfolios and Bitcoin stabilized around the 85% mark after seeing a decline over the past two weeks.\n\nFollowing a similar pattern, the correlation between the sector portfolios and Ethereum also stabilized after experiencing a small dip. Interestingly, the correlation of the DeFi and DEX portfolios remains elevated hovering around the 95% levels. On the contrary, the Web 3 and Currency portfolios are continuing to see a decline in their correlation with Ethereum.\n\nCover image source: Coin Companion",
